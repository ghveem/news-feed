Of course Apple’s going to scale up the core count on its higher-end computers. The question is merely by how much?</p><blockquote><p>For higher-end desktop computers, planned for later in 2021 and a new half-sized Mac Pro planned to launch by 2022, Apple is testing a chip design with as many as 32 high-performance cores.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, by about <em>that</em> much. At this point, Apple’s demonstrated that it has the know-how to build chips that outpace performance across much of the rest of the industry. The only thing limiting them now is A) how much money it wants to throw at improving its silicon and B) the limitations of physics. Given that the company is financially well positioned and custom silicon is now the technology underlying every single product it makes, the only <em>real</em> limitation is B.…</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/six-colors/>six-colors</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
