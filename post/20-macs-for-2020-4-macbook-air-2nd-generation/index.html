The MacBook Air weighed only three pounds. That made it a full two pounds (40 percent!) lighter than the next-lightest Mac laptop sold at the time, and more than a pound lighter than any previous Mac laptop. And it was impossibly thin, a 0.16 inch wedge at the front widening out to 0.76 inches in the rear. In other words, the original Air’s heart was in the right place—but the technology just wasn’t good enough yet.…</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/six-colors/>six-colors</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
