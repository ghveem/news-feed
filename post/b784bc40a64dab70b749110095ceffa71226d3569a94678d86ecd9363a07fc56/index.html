This would include redirecting any current merchants to select their plan and re-approve the new subscription through the Billing API and ensuring that all new merchants are billed through the API.<p>Shopify has also recently rolled out an annual subscription feature on the Billing API that makes the yearly subscription event easier on the API.<p>Additionally, we will require a report of the merchants who have been billed outside of the Billing API and retroactive revenue share payment for any/all qualifying 20% revenue dated January 2019 - Present.<p>Once the report has been reviewed, we will reach out with next steps on how to submit the transfer of funds to Shopify via wire transfer."<p>Pretty ironic too when you've got Shopify's CEO tweeting about the unfair 30% cut Apple wants: <a href=https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1362411841943711744 rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1362411841943711744</a></p><hr><p>Comments URL: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26260174">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26260174</a></p><p>Points: 308</p><p># Comments: 86</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/hacker-news-frontpage/>hacker-news-frontpage</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/panz3r/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
