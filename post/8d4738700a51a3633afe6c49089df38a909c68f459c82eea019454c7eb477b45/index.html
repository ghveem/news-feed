Our software helps companies manage a safe workplace where employees can work flexibly in-office or remote. Worksphere automates desk reservations, safe entry, and gives companies office usage data to right-size their workplaces.<p>We previously worked together at Lish, a corporate catering marketplace startup catering (pun intended) to tech companies. Last March our revenue went off a cliff. No people in office = no lunch orders. We love our clients and our team, so we got to work on solving a new problem for our primary users - HR, Office, and Facilities Managers.<p>At the start of the pandemic, our users were struggling with how to return to their offices safely. New problems like enforcing social distancing, screening for COVID-19 symptoms, and contact tracing could not be solved at scale with existing tools. New coronavirus workplace regulations have cropped up, which are a pain and come with big financial risk if companies don’t comply (we’re looking at you CA businesses dealing with SB 1159 & AB 685 - learn more at <a href=https://www.worksphere.com/blog/covid-19/guide-to-ab-685-and-sb-1159 rel=nofollow>https://www.worksphere.com/blog/covid-19/guide-to-ab-685-and...</a>).<p>As the pandemic has continued (and continued, and continued) businesses are facing a new challenge. 75% of office employees report that they want a hybrid in-office and remote schedule. No one misses their 5-day-a-week commute. At the same time, collaboration and culture are hard to foster on Zoom and Slack alone. Employees still want access to an office when needed, but don’t want to come to work in an empty space. Businesses want the upsides of flexibility, but don’t want to pay for empty or only occasionally used desks — office space costs $10-12k per employee annually in major US cities. We believe that a hybrid workweek is a better workweek, and that an active approach is needed to make it a win-win for employees and businesses.<p>Our features help businesses reopen safely and realize the full potential of a flexible workplace. We automate the wellness surveys, contact tracing, and capacity limits needed to enforce internal safety guidelines and regional regulations. This alleviates a ton of manual work for Office and HR managers. Employees can create in-office schedules and see who else is in the office to increase collaboration. We track office utilization data so companies can make smart decisions about their office space and lease.<p>Worksphere is $6 per active employee/month, and our clients only pay for employees that come to the office.<p>If you’re one of the 3 of 4 people who wants to work flexibly post-pandemic, or if you manage a workplace, we’d love to hear from you. How frequently do you think you’ll need office space? What problems are you facing in this changing work environment? We’ll reply in the comments or you can email us at info@worksphere.com.
