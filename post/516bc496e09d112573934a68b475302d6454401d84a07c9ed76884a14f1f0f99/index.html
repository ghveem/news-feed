This would protect countless Mac notebooks from repair after their power cords were tripped over by a pet or yanked out by a careless child.</p><p>MagSafe was introduced to great applause, and it quickly worked it way into the hearts of Mac users the world over. It showed up on the 13-inch MacBook a few months after the MacBook Pro was introduced, and was even present on the LED Cinema Display that came out in 2008.</p><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/08_led_mbp.jpg?ssl=1" alt="LED Cinema Display" data-image-w data-image-h class=jetpack-broken-image data-recalc-dims=1><figcaption>The younger readers among you may be shocked this 24-inch display cost only $899.
