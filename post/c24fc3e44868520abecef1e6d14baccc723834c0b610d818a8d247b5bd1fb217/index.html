We’re Matheus & Jérôme and we’re the co-founders of Tint(<a href=http://www.tint.ai rel=nofollow>http://www.tint.ai</a>). We help companies add insurance to their products.<p>Many companies, such as marketplaces, merchants, and travel agents could include insurance as part of their products and services to make them more valuable to their customers. For example, insurance will be included when you rent a campervan for a weekend trip at Outdoorsy, to protect you if anything goes wrong. Our platform provides everything that is needed: software, access to insurers, compliance—everything required to manage risk and protect users, profitably.<p>We met in 2014 when we were early employees at Turo, the car-sharing startup. While there, we saw the potential that insurance products have and also saw how hard it was to fully capitalize on it. Turo has an obvious and pressing need for insurance, but to fill it, they had to build their own systems, find insurers to back the program, and ensure compliance with state laws. None of this was their core business. We got inspired by the problem and by the opportunity to solve it, so we decided to create Tint.<p>Here is a real example from Riders Share, one of our clients: you go to their website/app to rent a motorbike for the weekend and find an awesome Harley Davidson. You proceed to checkout, see a few protection/insurance options, select one, and book the trip. You won't notice, but Riders Share's app has used Tint to risk-score the transaction, decide if it should be confirmed, and calculate how much the protection should cost.<p>Now, imagine you are a developer working on this project and need to add insurance to the product. What do you do? Instead of reinventing the wheel and adding more lines of code to maintain, you can leverage our APIs to integrate all the touchpoints required to sell insurance to your users (risk selection, quotes, issuing policy, claims, …). All the logic for the API responses is configured from our app so your insurance team can easily iterate on the next versions of your insurance product. Oh, and we also train machine learning models so we can recommend ways to improve its performance.<p>We're live in production and have helped our clients embed hundreds of thousands of insurance policies. While our tech applies to any insurance use case, we are initially targeting marketplaces that embed insurance.<p>We'd love to hear any of your ideas or experiences in this space.<p>Thanks, Matheus + Jérôme</p><hr><p>Comments URL: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26026526">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26026526</a></p><p>Points: 110</p><p># Comments: 30</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/hacker-news-frontpage/>hacker-news-frontpage</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/panz3r/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
