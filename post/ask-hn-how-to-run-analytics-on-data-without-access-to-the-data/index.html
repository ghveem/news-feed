What I would like to be able to do is run an analysis for anyone and return the little report that I get for myself. Without having access to their data or storing it in the first place. I know with for example oauth scopes, you can grant access, which sort of fits the criteria. But I'm thinking more exported data from an application, that doesn't have delegated access functionality<p>How I envisioned a solution would be some trusted third party takes my analysis script, returns the report and that is it. I never see the underlying data and recieve only one time token to access it.<p>I know it will never be hundred percent leak proof, and there is still a level of user trust, I realise that, but just thinking conceptually, is there any existing service out there, that does such a thing or attempts to offer something similar? Or what would an alternative approach look like?</p><hr><p>Comments URL: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25429749">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25429749</a></p><p>Points: 25</p><p># Comments: 26</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Tags</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/tags/hacker-news-frontpage/>hacker-news-frontpage</a></p></div><div class=clearit></div></div></div></main><footer><a href=https://github.com/panz3r>Panz3r</a> 2020 | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer></body></html>
