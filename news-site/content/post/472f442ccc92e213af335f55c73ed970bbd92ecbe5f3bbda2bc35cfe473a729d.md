  <p id="uFtcwt">So I have utterly failed at trying not to watch <em>Hannibal</em> right before bed; it definitely makes for weird dreams but it’s so <em>good. </em>I’m about halfway through season 2 now and getting very nervous for some of the characters I don’t remember from<em> Silence of the Lambs </em>and/or<em> Red Dragon. </em>I also hav<em>e Promising Young Woman </em>queued up and trying to avoid spoilers for<em> The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </em>until I can watch the first episode. Honestly too much good streaming content to keep up. </p>
<p id="GERG3X">That said, though, I am very excited by this week’s lineup because we have new trailers, plural, for <em>In the Heights</em>, the movie adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first Broadway play (he also wrote another one you may have heard of, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/theater/review-in-hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-forges-democracy-through-rap.html">about Alexander Hamilton</a>)....</p>
