  <p id="EWtIhZ">Adidas has a new version of its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fadidas-ultraboost-dna-x-lego-plates-shoes%2FFY7690.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372409%2Fadidas-lego-bricks-custom-ultraboost-dna-x-shoes-sneakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ultraboost DNA running shoes</a> with a unique twist — the company’s iconic three-stripe logo is now made of real plastic Lego bricks, allowing for a pair of more customizable kicks. </p>
<p id="YLUT7R">Officially known as the Adidas Ultraboost DNA X Lego Plates shoes, the new $200 brick sneakers feature transparent plastic slots on the side in the shape of flat two-by-six Lego plates: enough to fit three two-by-two Lego plates in each stripe. </p>
<p id="dplFIb">The shoes also feature a few other Lego homages, including a Lego logo on the tongue and brick-style detailing on the top and sole of the shoes. The interior lining is also done up in a bright Lego yellow. </p>
