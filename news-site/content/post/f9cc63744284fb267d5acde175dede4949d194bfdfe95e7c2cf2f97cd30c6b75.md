  <p id="UBIzWt">We may never see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled">LG’s incredible rollable phone</a> come to market, now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business">its smartphone days are done</a>, but at least the rollable TV we’ve been eagerly tracking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018">for years</a> is finally making it to the United States. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Flg-signature%2Frollable-oled-tv-r&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22384789%2Flg-rollable-tv-usa-united-states-price-release-date-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">You can now “inquire to buy” one</a> at the company’s website, as spotted by <a href="https://hdguru.com/lg-quietly-fielding-inquiries-in-u-s-for-rollable-oled-r-tvs/"><em>HD Guru</em></a><em> </em>(<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html">via <em>Engadget</em></a>).</p>
<p id="98g18O">While the company doesn’t list a price, we highly doubt you’ll nab one for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020">the $60,000 originally promised</a>; the motorized TV-in-a-box <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea">went on sale in South Korea</a> last October for 100 million won, or over $89,000 in today’s US dollars.
