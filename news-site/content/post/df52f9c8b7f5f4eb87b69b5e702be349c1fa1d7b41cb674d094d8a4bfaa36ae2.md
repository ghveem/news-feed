  <p id="r5cvPb">On Sunday evening, Taco Bell was serving up more than just tacos — it was also delivering NFTs: the fast-food chain <a href="https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/1368807880434982912">tweeted that it was selling taco-themed GIFs and images</a> on <a href="https://rarible.com/tacobell?tab=created">NFT marketplace Rarible</a>. Of course, everyone saw that it was a brand hopping on a bandwagon (one that could <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/">potentially be detrimental to the environment</a>), and promptly ignored it. No one bought them, and no articles were written.</p>
<p id="56lqqu">Just kidding! Taco Bell said that the demand for the NFTs was hot, and that the 25 tokens apparently sold out in 30 minutes. The NFTs are, of course, taco-themed, with four out of the five designs being animated GIFs.</p>
