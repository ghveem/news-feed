And for most of that time, I have wondered what it is about sports that makes them so appealing to so many people.</p>
<p>At the heart of the appeal of sports is its unpredictable narrative and unknowable outcome. As novelist Nick Hornby <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LYQ1IM/?tag=intertext-20">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A [sporting event] can’t be a work of art because there is nobody playing God. When you watch a play or a film, even a film directed by Tarantino or Hitchcock, you are aware, somewhere in you, that there are many, many people who know the ending… the people who willed it, wrote it, shaped it…. The glory of [the last day of the English Premier League season] was that all was chaos. Nobody in the world knew how it would turn out, and nobody — not the coaches, not the players on the pitch, not the referee, not the hundreds of millions watching around the world — could shape anything.
</p></blockquote>
<p>People these days are such savvy media consumers that many of them can guess the end of a book after the first chapter, including all the twists. Not only are they so well educated in the tricks of the trade that they can make an informed guess, but they’re so jaded that they make the guess, rather than sinking down into the narrative and enjoying the thrill ride.&#8230;</p>
