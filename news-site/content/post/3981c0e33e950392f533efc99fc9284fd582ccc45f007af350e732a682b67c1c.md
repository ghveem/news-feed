  <p id="I5E1RK">Jay “Sinatraa” Won, one of the biggest names in competitive <em>Valorant</em>, has been suspended from the game and by his team following accusations of sexual assault. In a statement <a href="https://twitter.com/cIe0h/status/1369497186740928512">posted on Tuesday</a>, Cleo Hernandez posted a lengthy account of her nine-month-long relationship with Won, detailing a disturbing history of physical and emotional abuse, supported by audio recordings and screenshots of messages.</p>
<p id="A5dxGJ">“I have avoided talking about any aspects of me and Jay’s relationship for over a year,” Hernandez wrote. “I never spoke about it mostly because this is horrifying, and also because I’ve seen the way women in our community are treated when they try to talk about being hurt by prominent figures.”</p>
