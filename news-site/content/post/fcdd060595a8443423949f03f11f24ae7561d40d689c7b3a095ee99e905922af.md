  <p id="Wow8GJ">MrBeast said last year that he wanted a way to invest in up-and-coming creators, help them blow up, and get a cut of their business in return — and today, he’s announcing a plan to do just that.</p>
<p id="IeLNV5">The hit YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is launching a $2 million investment fund that will offer creators up to $250,000 in exchange for a stake in their channels. The fund is part of a new company called <a href="https://getjuice.com/">Creative Juice</a>, in which Donaldson is an investor, and which was <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance">announced this afternoon in <em>The Information</em></a>.</p>
<p id="HTyauU">“We’re gonna make sure we find [creators] that actually need a giant cash inflow and aren’t just trying to go buy a Lamborghini,” Donaldson told <em>The Information</em>.</p>
