<p>I very recently realized that my product has more annual subscriptions than monthly ones. This was very surprising because it goes against everything I've read online. I offer only one tier that gives you access to all features; it costs $X/month or $10*X/year (the typical two-months-free-if-you-pay-annual thing you see everywhere). The split in subscribers between the monthly and annual plans is 44% and 56% respectively and I don't know how to interpret this information.<p>Does this mean I should simply increase prices? Is it fair to interpret this as the majority of the market saying "I'm happy to pay the highest tier your product offers"? I'm know that HN always suggests increasing prices all the time, but I'm wondering if my situation is an even stronger signal to increase prices.<p>Does this mean I should offer more than one tier and segment the market with different features for different prices?<p>My product isn't very niche or anything like that. It's a typical internet/web SaaS, so I believe most advice should be generally applicable.</p>
