  <p id="lYCYSU">If you missed Target’s PS5 restocks Thursday, you may be in luck. Best Buy has the <a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PS5 Digital Edition</a> and <a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> models up for purchase. </p>
<p id="fJwFGh">According to the product listing, Best Buy will only allow you to pick up your newly purchased PS5 at a local Best Buy store. No home delivery is available for either model. </p>

<p id="7Rd70W">Once you get your hands on a PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Demon’s Souls Remake</em></a> by Bluepoint Games and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></a>. </p>

<p id="Yh2iyW">If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, <a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">an extra DualSense controller</a> might also be a good item to pick up. </p>
<p id="QXm507">One thing I also recommend buying is <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a one-year membership to PlayStation...</a></p>
