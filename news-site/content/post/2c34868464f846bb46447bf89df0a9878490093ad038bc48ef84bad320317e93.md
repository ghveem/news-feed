  <p id="6x05WR">Facebook has resolved a major outage affecting Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and other Facebook services on Friday, according to a statement shared with <em>The Telegraph’s</em> Margi Murphy.</p>
<p id="slKktt">“Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have trouble accessing some Facebook services,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MargiMurphy/status/1372982240183951360">Facebook said</a>. “We resolved this issue for everyone, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” However, Murphy notes that she isn’t seeing the blue checkmarks that indicate someone has read your message, which could indicate there may be some small issues hanging around.</p>
