  <p id="O35Lzl">Hundreds of Reddit communities have locked down to protest Reddit’s handling of a controversy involving former UK politician Aimee Knight. More than 200 subreddits have set their status to private in the past day, including the 27 million-member forum r/Music, as well as large boards dedicated to Apple Mac computers and the games <em>Among Us</em> and <em>Pokémon Go</em>.</p>
<p id="EajxTP">Moderators are demanding a statement about Knight, whom Reddit apparently hired in recent months. Knight was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/12/green-party-failed-to-properly-investigate-child-abuser-report">previously suspended from the Green Party</a> after selecting her father — later convicted of violent sexual assault on a child — as her election agent in a 2017 political campaign.</p>
