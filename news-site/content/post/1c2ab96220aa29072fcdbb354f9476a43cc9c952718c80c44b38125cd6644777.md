  <p id="FJD1pF">Now that the street price of an Nvidia RTX 3070 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards">is over $1,200</a>, it’s temping to think scalpers, bots and cryptocurrency miners got them all — but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=pct">the latest Steam Hardware Survey</a> suggests at least some of them are making their way into gaming PCs, too. <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89161-latest-steam-survey-rtx-3070-month-top-performer.html%5C">As <em>TechSpot</em> reports</a>, the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU, and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.</p>
