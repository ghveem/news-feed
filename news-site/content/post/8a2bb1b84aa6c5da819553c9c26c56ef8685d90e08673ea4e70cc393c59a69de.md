  <p id="lWnmmf">NASA’s Perseverance rover, which is currently roaming around Mars, <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1378513754241961985">has dropped</a> off the mini helicopter Ingenuity ahead of the four-pound aircraft’s historic first flight.</p>
<p id="v8lsie">Ingenuity dropped four inches from the belly of Perseverance to the surface of Mars. While four inches might not seem like a very big drop, getting Ingenuity to successfully stick the landing is still a significant milestone, as the helicopter had to go through a multi-day process of flipping from a horizontal position on the rover to a vertical position before it was set down. (It also had to survive a seven-month trip through space to get to Mars. NBD.)</p>
