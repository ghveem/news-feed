  <p id="Ea9XbM">Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass platform just got a huge boost with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list">addition of 20 new Bethesda Softworks titles</a> starting today, and now a quarter of those games will be getting performance boosts on the next-gen Xbox consoles in an upcoming update. The performance gains are in frame rate thanks to an appropriately named <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287001/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-feature-games">new feature Microsoft revealed last month called FPS Boost</a>, which can roughly double frame rates of older games using new Xbox hardware without requiring developers do any manual work. </p>
<p id="tqMm8P">The games that will see performance boosts with frame rate jumps up to 60 frames per second include Arkane Studios’ <em>Dishonored: Definitive Edition </em>and <em>Prey</em> and Bethesda Game Studios’ <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</em>, <em>Fallout 4</em>,...</p>
