<blockquote><p>
  Keyboard Maestro has been the solution to almost every this-seems-impossible problem I’ve encountered on my Mac. It owes its power to some mind-boggling methods, like emulating keyboard shortcuts, invoking menu items, and monitoring what’s displayed on the screen itself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been meaning to write more about Keyboard Maestro for a while now, because what it does is nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>Keyboard Maestro does a zillion different things, including most of the things you can think of. It’ll open apps, move and resize windows, emulate keystrokes and simulate the pulling down of menu items. And you can do an awful lot with those features. But sometimes you can’t avoid needing to automate clicking on a something specific on the screen. Something you would probably use your human eyes and human brain to find. And if that thing isn’t in the exact same place on the screen every time, how can you automate it?</p>
<p>Keyboard Maestro has an answer: it looks at your screen for you, finds what it’s looking for, and lets you act on it.&#8230;</p>
