  <p id="UisRoq">If you’ve got a recent Canon DSLR or mirrorless camera and are interested in getting more use out of it, Canon announced today that it would soon begin selling webcam accessory kits, allowing Canon owners an easier way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released">retool their cameras as high-quality webcams</a>. </p>
<p id="sUFL66">Each kit has different parts, but all three packages include a USB cable to connect your camera to your desktop computer or laptop, and a battery insert and power cord so that you can continually keep your Canon camera powered with a wall outlet. It is important to note that none of these kits include a tripod to mount your camera. </p>
