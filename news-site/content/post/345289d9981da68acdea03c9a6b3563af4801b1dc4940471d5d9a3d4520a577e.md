  <p id="jWegYF">President Biden plans to announce a sweeping infrastructure plan Wednesday that includes $100 billion to connect every American to high-speed broadband internet over the next eight years. </p>
<p id="yBZ5Uy">Biden is scheduled <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-478627">to unveil his $2 trillion</a> “American Jobs Plan” in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday. The long-awaited infrastructure and jobs package contains funding for broadband expansion, semiconductor manufacturing, and slew of other interests like public transportation and helping consumers purchase electric vehicles. On a call with reporters Tuesday, an administration official said that the package would be paid for by changes to the corporate tax rate.</p>
