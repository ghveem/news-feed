  <p id="vdvayV">Myanmar’s acting military leadership has shut down broadband internet service indefinitely in response to ongoing protests, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/myanmar-military-internet-shutdown-bloodbath/">report from <em>The Washington Post</em></a> on Thursday. The move comes two months after a military junta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-aung-san-suu-kyi.html">staged a coup</a> to depose the country’s democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. </p>
<p id="VVs84d">The shutdown applies to wireless broadband service, while a separate order banning mobile internet at night remains in effect, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-04-01/myanmar-orders-wireless-internet-shutdown-until-further-notice-telecoms-sources"><em>Reuters </em>reports</a>. The orders were given to state telecoms, though no official reason has been given.</p>
