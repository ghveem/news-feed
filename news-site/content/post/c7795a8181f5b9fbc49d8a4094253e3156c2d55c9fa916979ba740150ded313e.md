A special system was supposed to make the RTX 3060 undesirable for cryptominers, but Nvidia has now confirmed that it has accidentally unlocked those restrictions with a new driver.</p>
<p id="UuV5dd">“A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations,” says an Nvidia spokesperson in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “The driver has been removed.”</p>

Nvidia’s latest 470.05 beta driver <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining">automatically unlocks performance for most RTX 3060 cards</a>, boosting hashing rates for Ethereum...</p>
