  <p id="nONfdU">After pausing its review of emoji submissions, the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee is back with tips for successful submissions, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdaniel/status/1382758288316502017">chair Jennifer Daniel announced.</a> Anything you submit now could come to phones as soon as 2023 — but if you want to fine-tune your emoji, she’s got some suggestions.</p>
<p id="CPFPX1">A good emoji has multiple uses, can be used with other emoji to create an emoji phrase, represents something new, and is distinct from existing emoji, Daniel writes. </p>
