<p>Dan Goodin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/if-youre-getting-bombarded-with-facetime-group-calls-youre-not-alone/">writing at Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  FaceTime users are getting bombarded with group calls from numbers they’ve never seen before, often as many as 20 times in short succession during late hours of the night.</p>
<p>  Griefers behind the pranks call as many as 31 numbers at a time. When a person receiving one of the calls hangs up, a different number will immediately call back. FaceTime doesn’t have the ability to accept only FaceTime calls coming from people in the user’s address book. It also requires all numbers in a group call must be manually blocked for the call to be stopped.

<p>This is kind of similar to my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/wish-list-better-anti-spam-tools-for-messages/">group text spam</a> from a couple weeks back, and only reinforces that Apple’s built-in tools—if they may be generously called such—for dealing with spam are lacking. The company’s answer seems to be a shrugging “we’ll leave this to third parties” and while that might work for phone calls and SMS text spam, FaceTime is <em>Apple</em>‘s system. Nobody else to blame there.&#8230;</p>
