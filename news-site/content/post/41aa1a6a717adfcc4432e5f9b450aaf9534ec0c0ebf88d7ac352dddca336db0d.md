<p><a href="http://bzgapps.com/sixcolors">Unite 4 for macOS</a> allows you to turn any website into an app on your Mac. Using a lightweight, WebKit powered browser as a backend, you can easily create isolated, customizable apps from any site.</p>
<p>Unite 4 includes dozens of new features, including support for native notifications, new customization options, M1 support, and much more. Unite apps also serve as a great alternative for resource hogging Electron apps or half-baked Catalyst apps.</p>
<p>Some examples of apps you could create in mere minutes with Unite:</p>
<ul><li>A Gmail web client that behaves like a native mail client.
</li>
<li>
<p>A status bar app for Apple Music or Overcast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An isolated workspace for apps that may track you like Facebook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lightweight and power efficient version of Slack, Discord, or Whatsapp with full notification support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fully featured Instagram app that has a resizable window, unlike the M1 version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Robinhood, Figma, or Roam Research app for your desktop.</p>
</li>
