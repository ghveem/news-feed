  <p id="2Bd3L0">You can switch from your old phone to a new Google Pixel, or you can close your eyes, breathe, and then <em>mindfully switch to a new Google Pixel</em>. Sorry, I’m trying to force myself into the higher plane of existence that the narrator of this new ad-meets-ASMR meditation session from Google is on, and the edibles haven’t kicked in yet. </p>
<p id="Rjb4ia">The video above guides you through the process of getting all of your data onto a new Pixel, with meditative advice laid atop a slideshow of gorgeous vistas. It’s relaxing at first, but don’t take it too seriously. The chill vibes eventually give way to a cutting line of existential dread that then pivots the video completely into cringey meme territory. </p>
