  <p id="noucI8"><em>Fantasian</em>, a new role-playing game from <em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasian/id1517339045">available now</a> for Apple Arcade. The game is playable on iOS, Mac, and Apple TV.</p>
<p id="nF89kX"><em>Fantasian</em> is the latest from Sakaguchi’s studio Mistwalker, which he founded in 2004; the developer has since released games such as <em>The Last Story</em> and <em>Blue Dragon</em>. Although <em>Fantasian</em> uses traditional RPG elements like turn-based battles, it’s been designed with handcrafted physical models — more than 150 dioramas in all. </p>
<p id="dW921S"><em>Fantasian</em> features touch controls but, according to Sakaguchi, is intended to deliver a console-like experience on mobile devices. The game follows an amnesiac hero searching for a way to regain his lost memories.
