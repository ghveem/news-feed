  <p id="QERtK2">Warner Bros. has released <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1EbSXxrZ34">the first trailer</a> for <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, the sequel to 2016’s <em>Suicide Squad</em> (no The). Unlike the extremely grimdark <em>Zack Snyder’s Justice League</em> (and the potentially even more grimdark black-and-white version of the film, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351394/zack-snyder-justice-league-black-and-white-hbo-max"><em>Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray</em></a>),<em> The Suicide Squad</em> looks to be filled with color and humor, at least based on this first trailer.</p>

<p id="6EBcTA">I’m getting some serious <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> vibes from <em>The Suicide Squad</em>’s trailer — which makes sense, given that both movies are directed by James Gunn. I love the first <em>Guardians</em> movie, so I’m hoping Gunn brings some of the humor and heart from that film...</p>
