<p>If I close my eyes, I can picture the classic Mac OS laid out before me. I can imagine every menu, every mouse gesture, the sound of the Mac SE chime, even depressing the reset switch after a hard crash.</p>
<p>The thing is, I didn’t become a Mac user until early 1990. I had used two other computers before I found the Mac. I can’t remember anything about the Commodore PET other than the <code>READY.</code> prompt. The Apple IIe made a bigger impression, but in <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/01/reading-disks-from-1988-in-2018/">retrieving all my old disks</a> from that period, I discovered that I remember almost nothing beyond how to control a few of my favorite games.</p>
<p>I’m not sure quite why the classic Mac is so indelible, though some of it has to be its consistency. In the early days of the personal computer, you either had <em>no</em> user interface, or every user interface was different. My Commodore PET was an all-text experience. The Apple IIe was much more interesting, but commands and controls varied from program to program. The Mac’s personality was present and consistent, even as I swapped disks or switched between apps.</p>
