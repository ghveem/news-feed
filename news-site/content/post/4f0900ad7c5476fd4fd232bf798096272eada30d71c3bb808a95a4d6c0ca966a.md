<p>Maybe someday there will be a tell-all book written by someone inside Apple during the 2010s. Maybe we will eventually know exactly what happened that led to a bit of a lost decade for the Mac, one that will be remembered for a failed attempt to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2041203/the-wait-is-nearly-over-apple-unveils-new-mac-pro.html">rethink the Mac Pro</a> and a series of questionable hardware decisions that hobbled Mac laptops for years.</p>
<p>But until then, we’re mostly left to speculate about what happened—and how Apple turned it around, ushering in a new decade that’s got the potential to reinvigorate the Mac in a way not seen since the early days of Steve Jobs’s return to Apple.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, there’s a single Mac model that tells a good portion of the story all on its own. It’s a Mac that was a remarkably good computer on its own, but also one that represented an approach to the Mac that Apple itself would end up repudiating.</p>
<p>Pour one out for one of the best Macs of the 2010s, and perhaps the one that best represents that confused decade. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3610715/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-as-signs-point-to-imminent-m1-launch.html">The iMac Pro is dead</a>—but it lived fast and left an exquisite corpse.&#8230;</p>
