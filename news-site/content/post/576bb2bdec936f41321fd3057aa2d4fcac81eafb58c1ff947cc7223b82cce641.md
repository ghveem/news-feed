  <p id="4Ocr4Y">Slack’s newest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature">direct message feature</a>, part of a broader cross-organizational tool called Slack Connect, lets anyone with a professional Slack account DM another user so long as they have their email address. These messages, which are attached to invites, can be potentially abusive or harmful, points out <a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891">Menotti Minutillo</a>, a Twitter product employee who works on the company’s developer platform trust team.</p>
<p id="EpNUza">There’s no way to block these invites, either. You could also trick someone into accepting your invite and then send them harassment or abusive messages. </p>
