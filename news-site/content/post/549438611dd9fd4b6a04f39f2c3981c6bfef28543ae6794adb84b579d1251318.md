  <p id="fgxoSP">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri confirms that a version of the popular photo sharing app for children under 13 is in the works, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"><em>BuzzFeed News </em>reports</a>. The Facebook-owned company knows a lot of kids want to use Instagram, Mosseri said, but there isn’t a “detailed plan yet,” according to <em>BuzzFeed News.</em> </p>
<p id="nTYa6R">“But part of the solution is to create a version of Instagram for young people or kids where parents have transparency or control,” Mosseri told <em>BuzzFeed News</em>. “It’s one of the things we’re exploring.” Instagram’s current policy bars children under 13 from the platform.</p>
