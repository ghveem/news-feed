  <p id="gumS06">Atari, the corporate entity / brand of Theseus, has just made around $110,000 by selling —you guessed it — NFTs (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/ataris-corporate-zombie-raises-110000-overnight-from-centipede-nfts">shout out to <em>Ars Technica</em></a> for doing the math). The tokens in question are 3D models of the Atari 2600 game cartridge for <em>Centipede</em> — 10 of them black, 100 of them red.</p>
<p id="FiMgs6">The NFTs are being sold as part of the <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/launches-atari-capsule-collection">Atari Capsule Collection</a> — which is basically a bunch of <em>Centipede</em> and <em>Pong</em>-themed NFTs being sold by the company that now owns the Atari brand.
