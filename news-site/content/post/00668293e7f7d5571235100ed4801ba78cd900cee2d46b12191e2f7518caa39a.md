  <p id="hPKsBP">Spotify’s much-anticipated in-car gadget, a voice-controlled music player known colloquially as the Car Thing, has just shown up in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">handful of in-app renders unearthed by <em>MacRumors </em>contributor Steve Moser</a>, who found the images in Spotify’s app code. These renders match up quite closely with photographs of the real deal submitted as part of filings to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos"><em>The Verge </em>reported<em> </em>back in January</a>. </p>

Earlier official company renders from back when the product was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant">formally announced in 2019</a> showed off a much smaller screen. </p>
