  <p id="FbGdDN">Amazon has issued a rare public apology — but not to its workers, and with no real admission of guilt. </p>
<p id="0kyRhC">Over a week ago, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence">was caught publicly lying</a> to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers never feel the need to pee in water bottles (which is, in fact, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles">a well-documented issue at Amazon</a> because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations">how it robotically tracks and fires its laborers</a>). </p>

Amazon only apologizes for not being “accurate” enough, too — not for actually creating and contributing to situations where workers pee in bottles. </p>
