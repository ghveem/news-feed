<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost">new iPad Pro models are on the way</a> as early as April, with some interesting new features:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The company is planning a refresh to its iPad Pro line, adding a better processor and improved cameras, the people said. The new models will look similar to the current iPad Pros and come in the same 11-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes.</p>
<p>  The devices will have an updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini… Apple is also looking to include a Mini-LED screen with at least the larger model, which would be brighter and have improved contrast ratios.</p>
<p>  In testing, the new iPad Pros have used a Thunderbolt connector, the same port on the latest Macs with custom Apple processors. The port doesn’t require new chargers, but it would enable connectivity with additional external monitors, hard drives and other peripherals. It’s also faster at syncing data than the USB-C technology used in the current models.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think an iPad Pro with an M1-generation chip (probably called A14X) is particularly surprising, and reports have suggested for a while that Apple has been experimenting with Mini-LED backlights for improved screen quality.&#8230;</p>
