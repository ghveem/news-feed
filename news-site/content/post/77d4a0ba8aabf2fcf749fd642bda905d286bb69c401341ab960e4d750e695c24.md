<p>I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/nova-review-panics-code-editor-demonstrates-why-mac-like-design-matters/">this review of Panic’s code editor Nova</a> by Alex Guyot of MacStories. <a href="https://nova.app">Nova</a> is a remarkable Mac-only app that I’m looking forward to using with all updates to the Six Colors WordPress template going forward.</p>
<p>But Alex also makes a fantastic point about one of his (and my, as it turns out) pet peeves:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  One of my main frustrations with pretty much all of the popular code editors out there (and I’ve tried most of them, including <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>, and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a>) is that none of them are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps">Mac-assed Mac apps</a>. They’re all clearly cross-platform apps with design senses that differ significantly from those of Mac-first developers.</p>
<p>  You can see a microcosm of this fact just by looking at the preferences of these apps. For many of them, the ‘Preferences’ menu bar item is actually a submenu from which you can navigate to ‘Settings,’ as well as other more nebulous options. If that doesn’t already offend Mac users, a common theme in those settings screens is for them to be literal JSON text files that open in the editor. You then manually edit the text to adjust options.</p></blockquote>&#8230;
