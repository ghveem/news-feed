  <p id="LLZjN2">Bird says it will spend $150 million on a major expansion in Europe. The Santa Monica-based scooter sharing company announced that it will bring its battery-powered two-wheelers to 50 new cities on the continent in the coming months, in addition to growing its fleet in its current markets. The move comes as scooter sharing continues to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/vc-investors-are-wild-for-europes-e-scooter-rental-startups.html">perform strongly in Europe</a> amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p id="xKHvuW">To help oversee this new initiative, Bird is promoting to two employees to its executive team: Renaud Fages is named head of global operations; and Brendan O’Driscoll will be head of product, growth and data, overseeing both Bird’s global product strategy and its implementation. </p>
