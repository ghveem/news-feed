This breakthrough will make it easier for physicists to study the volatile material. Cooling antihydrogen atoms to almost zero Kelvin slows...<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89136-cern-physicists-figured-out-how-study-antimatter-cooling.html"><img src="https://static.techspot.com/images/rss/rss_buttons_01.png" border="0" alt="Read Entire Article" /></a><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89136-cern-physicists-figured-out-how-study-antimatter-cooling.html#comments"><img src="https://static.techspot.com/images/rss/rss_buttons_02.png" border="0" alt="Read Comments" /></a><br /><br />
