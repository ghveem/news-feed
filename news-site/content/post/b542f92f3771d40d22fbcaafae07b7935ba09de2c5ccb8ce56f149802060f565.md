  <p id="BOv3vh">A pair of Microsoft support pages have appeared for the unannounced Surface Laptop 4, suggesting a launch may be imminent. One is a placeholder for an <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2F102923" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMD version</a> of the laptop, while the other is for an <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2F102924" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Intel model</a>.

The AMD processors used will reportedly be from its 4000 mobile series, and will include the Ryzen 5 4680U and the Ryzen 7 4980U. That’s a step up from the 3000-series chips used in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923620/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-15-inch-review-windows-test-price-specs-features">2019’s Surface Laptop 3</a>, but anyone hoping to see...</p>
