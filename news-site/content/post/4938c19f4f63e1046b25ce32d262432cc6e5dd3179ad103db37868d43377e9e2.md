  <p id="4TDBLq">Tesla now accepts bitcoin as payment for its cars in the US, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105">CEO Elon Musk announced</a> on Twitter. The option to pay using the cryptocurrency now appears on the company’s US website, where it’s available alongside the traditional card payment option. Musk said that the option to pay with bitcoin will be available to other countries “later this year.” </p>
<p id="TJpkZd">As well as confirming the availability of the new payment option, Musk offered some details on how Tesla is handling the cryptocurrency. “Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,” he said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619379929772034">followup tweet</a>, “Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.”</p>
