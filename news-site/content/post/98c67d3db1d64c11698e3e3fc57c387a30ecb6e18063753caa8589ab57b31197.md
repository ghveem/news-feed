<p>Last week we visited my mother in Arizona for the first time in more than a year. Driving 1800 miles and trading sitting isolated in one house for sitting isolated in another isn’t the most pulse-pounding Spring Break you’d ever imagine, but there was one thing that added novelty to the trip: A friend of mine who is currently working overseas for a year kindly offered to let us take a road trip in his Tesla Model 3, which was literally gathering dust in his boss’s garage. Before this trip I had been a passenger in a Tesla exactly one time, for less than 20 miles.</p>

And I was right—as the valley, city, and desert landscapes whizzed by, I learned an awful lot.</p>
<h2>Let’s take a ride in an electric car</h2>
<p>A few years ago, we bought an electric car—a used 2012 Nissan Leaf. It’s only got about 60 miles of range, and that’s being extremely charitable (and only if you drive 55 mph on the freeway, which will make all the other drivers around you very angry).&#8230;</p>
