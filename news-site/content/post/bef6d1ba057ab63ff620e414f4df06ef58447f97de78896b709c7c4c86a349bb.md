  <p id="gcY3B9">Samsung has just announced an Unpacked event coming up on March 17th, 2021, its second for the year so far. The invitation calls the event “Galaxy Awesome Unpacked.” Between recent A-series leaks and the chaotic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLTrNq2MnBM">“awesome”-themed promotional video</a> for last year’s models, it seems safe to assume that we’ll see the Galaxy A52 and A72 devices debut.</p>

<p id="g8RuIw">An entire event dedicated to unveiling midrange devices is a little unusual, but the leaked information we’ve seen thus far has pointed to Samsung taking these phones very seriously.  The A52 5G looks like it will receive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak">monthly security updates</a> — something Samsung has tended to reserve for higher-end phones — and spec leaks have indicated we can expect <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen">high-refresh rate screens</a>. </p>
