<p>Speaking of OS X history, here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/1374794319148806144">James Thomson on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s really a weird experience rewatching Steve introducing the Dock for the first time, as it was my code that was running here. To say I was terrified for the whole length of this segment is underselling it. I don’t think I’ve seen this since.

<p>This demo—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjlLG1EzJ2k">the YouTube video is here</a>—is from a developer preview version of OS X. Notice that when Jobs drags files into the Dock, they disappear from the Desktop! As James reminded me, they were moved into a Dock folder inside your user folder.</p>
<p>The Dock, though it was rewritten multiple times before OS X shipped, is one of the only NextStep interface design influences to make an impact on OS X.&#8230;</p>
