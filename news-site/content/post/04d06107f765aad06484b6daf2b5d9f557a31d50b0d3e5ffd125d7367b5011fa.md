A decade ago they were clunky machines built to assist with routine procedures. Today, theyâ€™re capable of conducting end-to-end surgeries without human aid. Recent leaps in the field of deep learning have made difficult tasks such as surgery, electronics assembly, and piloting a fighter jet relatively simple. It might take a decade to train a human in all the necessary medical knowledge required for them to perform brain surgery. And that cost is the same for each subsequent human surgeon thereafter.
