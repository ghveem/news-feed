  <p id="UfjAMp">Sony has just invested another $200 million in Epic Games as part of a $1 billion funding round, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse">Epic announced today</a>. Over a dozen investors contributed toward the funding round, which valued the <em>Fortnite</em> developer at $28.7 billion. That’s over $10 billion more than Epic Games’ estimated value at the time of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318978/sony-epic-games-fortnite-investment-250-million-game-development">Sony’s major investment last July</a>.</p>
<p id="MMisTY">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is still the company’s controlling shareholder after the  investment. In a press release, Sweeney said that Epic will use the investment to “help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store.”</p>
