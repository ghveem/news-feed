  <p id="x1onyQ"><em>Balan Wonderworld</em>, a new game from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335755/balan-wonderworld-xbox-series-x-sonic-creators-gameplay-trailer">two of the original creators of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a>, is out today. But before you jump into the game, make sure you’ve installed its day one patch. It fixes sequences in a “potential flashing bug” that could present a seizure risk. On Thursday, a video of the game’s final boss fight was uploaded to YouTube, and in it, there are occasional moments where the entire screen is taken over by rapid white flashes without warning.</p>
<p id="sLXNye">“We have received reports of a photo-sensitive epilepsy risk from a potential flashing bug if playing the game un-patched,” the <em>Balan Wonderworld</em> account <a href="https://twitter.com/balanwworld/status/1375399583346524162">said on Twitter</a>. “The Day 1 Patch prevents this issue as well as enhances the overall play experience.”</p>
