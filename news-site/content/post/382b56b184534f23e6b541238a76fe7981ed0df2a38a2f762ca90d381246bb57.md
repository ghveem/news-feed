  <p id="UHic9y">NASA has released an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa%2Fperseverance-mars-supercam-laser-impacts-on-rock-target%2Fs-5xUEkUbSPpW&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22324870%2Fnasa-perseverance-supercam-laser-strike-audio-recording-micrphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">audio recording</a> of its Perseverance rover firing lasers on the martian surface. The strikes, which sound like a series of small clicks, are designed to help scientists analyze the rocks around the rover. In this case the target was a rock called “Máaz,” which scientists were able to discover was basaltic, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56354383"><em>BBC News</em> reports</a>, meaning it contains a lot of magnesium and iron.</p>
<p id="SfDRdh">According to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/microphones/">NASA’s site</a>, the laser is fired by Perseverance’s “SuperCam,” and allows the rover to “zap and study areas on a rock as small as the period at the end of this sentence” from a distance of 20 feet (7 meters) away. Once the laser has fired at a rock, it uses its camera and spectrometer to analyze the hot gas the rock is vaporized into. The...</p>
