  <p id="wWVwYo">LG has <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-announces-three-year-pledge-for-os-updates/">announced</a> a pledge to issue future Android OS updates to many of its smartphones despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business">confirming</a> earlier this week that it’ll be leaving the phone business altogether. The Velvet, Wing, and G- and V- series phones from 2019 or later should be getting three Android updates from their year of release, and “certain 2020 models such as LG Stylo and K series” will get two updates.</p>

LG variously describes this announcement as a “three-year pledge” and a “three-OS-update guarantee.”</p>
