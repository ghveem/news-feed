  <p id="GYNqFZ">Dropbox is adding a feature that will let you add automation to folders so new files are automatically renamed, grouped into subfolders, or more. The feature is called, perhaps unsurprisingly, Automated Folders, and <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-features-to-keep-files-organized">Dropbox says</a> it can help you (and any co-workers you share files with) stay organized with standardized names and tags.</p>
<p id="KyrMvQ">The automation you add to folders can be configured with various rules, so you can tell the system to rename any files you add to the folder following a certain pattern or to sort them into subfolders based on the date the file was uploaded to Dropbox. The rules are currently predefined, but Dropbox says itâ€™s working to make the system more customizable. </p>
