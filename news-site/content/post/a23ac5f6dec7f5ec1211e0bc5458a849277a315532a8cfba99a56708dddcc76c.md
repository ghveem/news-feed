For years, MLB’s website showed live games in a Flash-based interface, though that’s recently been rectified. In 2015 I wrote about <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/03/testing-out-the-mlbtv-mac-app/">a Mac app for MLB.TV</a> that was a tech experiment—and was never supported.</p>
<p>What I really want is to put a game in a picture-in-picture window on my Mac, like I do on my iPad. In the past I’ve resorted to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/03/how-to-watch-mlb-tv-in-picture-in-picture-on-a-mac/">using a bookmarklet</a> to pop the video out of the web page—but with various ad rolls and other stuff, it frequently would stop playing. Not great.</p>
<p>Since today is opening day, I thought I’d remind baseball fans with M1-based Macs that the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mlb/id493619333">MLB iPad app works on the Mac</a>. Not only do you get access to Gameday, highlights, and all the rest, but you can also pop on a live game and click the picture-in-picture icon to pop that video out into a floating window. Then you can hide the app itself, and go about your business.</p>
<p>It’s just like how it works on the iPad. Because it’s literally the same app.</p>
<p>Happy opening day, baseball fans.&#8230;</p>
