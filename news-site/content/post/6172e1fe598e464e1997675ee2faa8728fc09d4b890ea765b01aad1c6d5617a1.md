  <p id="tVJFt8">Mobvoi is starting to sell the TicWatch GTH today, a $79.99 fitness wearable that features sensors for skin temperature and blood oxygen that are typically reserved for more expensive watches. Mobvoi has generally focused on Wear OS devices in the past, providing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os">a variety</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18217223/mobvoi-ticwatch-e2-s2-review-price-size-battery-release-date-smartwatch-wear-os">of options</a> for Google’s troubled wearable operating system, but the TicWatch GTH seems more like a Fitbit competitor than anything else.</p>
<p id="JMbsP4">The TicWatch GTH has an Apple Watch-esque square body, a noticeably bezeled 1.55-inch screen, and only comes in “raven black.” Mobvoi claims the GTH’s 260mAh battery can last more than a week on one charge, “depending on usage,” and that the watch is also water-resistant up to 5ATM or 50 meters.
