  <p id="PqEMwp">A judge has <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.326502/gov.uscourts.cand.326502.306.2.pdf">certified a class action suit</a> against Apple for its fragile butterfly keyboard design. The suit covers anyone who purchased an Apple MacBook with a butterfly keyboard in seven states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, and Michigan. That includes people who bought a MacBook model dating between 2015 and 2017, a MacBook Pro model between 2016 and 2019, or a MacBook Air between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p id="OSU6Sr">Judge Edward Davila certified the case with seven subclasses on March 8th in California, but the order remained sealed until late last week. It raises the stakes for a suit that was first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/23/second-macbook-pro-keyboard-class-action/">filed in 2018</a>, three years after Apple added the controversial butterfly switches to its laptops.</p>
