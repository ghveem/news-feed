<p>I use Twitter a lot, and have for a long time. But I recently discovered that there’s a feature of Twitter that most people don’t use—and it’s one that I’ve been using heavily for years in order to make Twitter work better for me: the Twitter List.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twitterrific-lists.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption>My Sports List in action.</figcaption></figure><p>Twitter Lists are essentially alternate Twitter timelines. If you follow someone on Twitter, their tweets appear in your main timeline. If you add someone to a List, their tweets appear only in that List. If you’re overwhelmed with the amount of stuff in your Twitter timeline, one way to calm it down is to move a bunch of the people you follow into Lists and stop following them.</p>
<p>(Alternately, you could continue to follow a huge number of people—but secretly add the people you <em>really</em> care about to a List, and only read that List.)</p>
<p>Twitter Lists can be public or private. Private Lists belong to you, and you alone—nobody else can see that List. If you choose to make a List public, you’re allowing other people to browse it and subscribe to it. Similarly, when someone else has curated an interesting Twitter List, you can subscribe to it.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>
