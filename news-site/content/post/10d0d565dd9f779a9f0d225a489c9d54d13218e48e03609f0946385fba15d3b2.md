<p>I'm the founder of a tech startup in the field of telephony and we use Twilio for parts of our service.<p>A little over 3 hours ago our entire account was suspended without reason. We received an email stating that fact without further explanation.<p>Since then, we are trying to get in contact with them through every channel we could find: email, Twitter, LinkedIn, and I even tried emailing Jeff Lawson, their CEO. They don't have a support number we can call.<p>We are not a small customer and we have been with them for more than 6 years. It's deeply frustrating that despite that fact, we don't seem to matter to them at all.<p>If you work at Twilio or if you can help us get in touch with them, I'd be indebted to you forever!</p>
