  <p id="WQUkPC">Apple’s long-rumored mixed reality headset could weigh less than 150 grams, which would make it much lighter than many other headsets on the market, according to a new research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/">seen by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>. That lighter weight might mean Apple’s headset could be easier to wear for long periods of time.</p>
<p id="EZQuSz">A weight of 150 grams would make Apple’s headset lighter than the Oculus Quest 2 (503 grams), Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 (645 grams), and the Valve Index (809 grams). It would be lighter than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13161506/google-vr-headset-photos-daydream-view-virtual-reality">Google’s Daydream View</a>, a fabric VR headset designed to hold your phone, which weighed 220 grams. The headset could even be lighter than your iPhone, given that the standard iPhone 12 weighs 164 grams.</p>
<p id="3tWljz">As attractively light as this...</p>
