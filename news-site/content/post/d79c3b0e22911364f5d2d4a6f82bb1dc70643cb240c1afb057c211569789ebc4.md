<p>Ben Smith of the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html?searchResultPosition=1">wrote an excellent piece</a> about the rise of writers building their own businesses, most prominently newsletters based on the Substack platform. This part, about competitors to Substack, struck me for some obvious reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://ghost.org/newsletter-authors/">Ghost</a> isn’t the only alternative, of course. Twitter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/technology/twitter-revue-newsletter.html">recently bought</a> the newsletter platform Revue, and Facebook is developing ambitious plans for a rival that will provide a platform for local journalists, among other writers. The left-wing commentary site Discourse Blog <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/business/media/substack-newsletters-journalists.html">moved</a> to a rival platform called Lede. Others, like the tech analyst Ben Thompson, cobble together email, blogging and payment services to be what he calls “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">sovereign writers</a>.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Ben Thompson, we here at Six Colors are cobblers. We have used Memberful, MailChimp, WordPress and Stripe to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">build a membership program</a> that lets us post free stories as well as members-only content, and then bundle it all up into an end-of-week newsletter.</p>
<p>Would I move to Substack if I were leaving my job at IDG today? Possibly, though it’s more limited in form than what I’ve been able to put together here. But that’s kind of the point of services like Substack—not everyone wants to be a cobbler. In fact, most independent writers who are likely to benefit from moving to a platform like Substack are probably not well versed in all the technical details of going independent and shouldn’t waste their time figuring it out when they should be writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Substack and its backers are alert to the risk that the service could be replaced by someone charging a few dollars a month.</p></blockquote>&#8230;
