  <p id="6SkMLe">Well, that didn’t take long. <em>Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray</em>, the black and white version of the film that hews closer to the director’s ideal vision for his superhero epic, <a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1374981675248128000?s=20">is out today on HBO Max</a>. Justice is Gray’s release <a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1373424594787446786?s=20">was first teased last week</a>.</p>
<p id="KDRcjz">Outside of the notable lack of color, the film still streams in its now familiar 4:3 aspect ratio, which if anything, I’ve fully come around to since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning">the initial hullabaloo</a> around the “integrity-preserving” choice.
