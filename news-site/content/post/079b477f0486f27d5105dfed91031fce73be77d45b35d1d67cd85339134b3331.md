<p>The new Overcast Apple Watch is <em>great</em>. I have a cellular watch and when I run, I’m using it in standalone mode—I bring my AirPods Pro, but I leave my iPhone at home. The problem with the old Overcast watch app was that it was conceived in an era where the Apple Watch was much more tethered to the iPhone than it needs to be today.</p>

That’s because while the watch app was capable of streaming podcast audio via cellular, it relied on the iPhone for its database of what podcasts were available. If I didn’t make sure the watch synced to the iPhone before leaving the hosue, sometimes I’d end having to listen to stale podcasts when I knew fresher episodes were out there.&#8230;</p>
