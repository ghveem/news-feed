<p>Hey HN! I'm Andy Su and I'm here with my cofounders Hayden Jensen, Tiffany Wong, and Alex Sailer. We are the cofounders of Pry (<a href="https://pry.co" rel="nofollow">https://pry.co</a>). Pry is solving finance for founders. Instead of using Excel, founders and finance analysts can use Pry to manage their budget, hiring plan, and cash runway.<p>As a long time HN lurker, I'm excited to share this project with you. In a previous life, I cofounded a tech-enabled accounting company. We help thousands of companies keep their books (accounting) up to date. While growing, I could feel Javascript improve year after year but the way our finances were done in Excel just got worse and worse.<p>The product I wanted was simple: something to replace the Excel files that the finance gurus use. I looked around and couldn't find anything that did what I wanted so I decided to start working on it (originally <a href="http://budgithub.com" rel="nofollow">http://budgithub.com</a>) two years ago.<p>There is a lot to build. Most Excel files have these components:<p>- A summary view with budgets and actuals<p>- Separate tabs for different departments<p>- A hiring plan (list of employees) and a hidden pivot table to make things work<p>- A revenue model<p>- A dashboard<p>Today, I'm happy to announce that we have finally launched a release that covers all of these components and it's available for anyone to try for free.<p>We built this tool to serve the startup and small business community. Our pricing ranges from $50-$100/mo and we're determined to continue offering our full suite of functionality at an affordable price.<p>We have a lot to build still - integrations, currency support, etc, but if you are using Quickbook Online, Xero, or don't have accounting set up, give us a try. We connect to most US banks, and we have a few happy overseas customers using Pry + Xero.<p>One of our guiding design principles is the Ruby on Rails "convention over configuration". We've done a lot of things the hard way. Happy to answer any questions over the next few hours.</p>
