  <p id="sCdoLo">Microsoft is reportedly planning to release a new webcam this spring. The software giant has previously offered a variety of webcams under its LifeCam brand, but Microsoft hasn’t updated these significantly for 10 years. <a href="https://petri.com/microsoft-to-unveil-new-webcam-this-spring"><em>Petri </em>reports</a> that a Surface event will take place this spring, and a new webcam will be on the agenda alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319854/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-specs-features-release-price-leak">Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop 4</a>.</p>
<p id="M1Mpyv">The webcam will reportedly include a privacy cover and support high dynamic range (HDR). While Microsoft uses 4K USB-C webcams on its Surface Hub 2 device, this new webcam is rumored to skip 4K support. It’s not clear what resolution will be supported, or whether it will support Windows Hello facial recognition.</p>
