  <p id="gBFX4j">Samsung is reportedly working on a double-folding phone to add to its lineup, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-bets-big-on-foldable-smartphones-amid-chip-crunch">according to <em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/22/samsung-double-folding-smartphone-report/">via <em>9to5Google</em></a>). According to the article, the phone would fold into three segments using two hinges and could be announced “as early as the end of this year.” The phone would be a third option in Samsung’s foldable lineup, joining the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review">Galaxy Z Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200">Z Flip</a>, both of which are also expected to appear in new versions this year.</p>
<p id="K6Tzqm">According to the report, the design is still being finalized, but <em>Nikkei</em>’s sources say its screen could have a more standard 16:9 or 18:9 aspect ratio, making it easier for app makers to design for than the 25:9 screen found on the Z Fold. </p>
