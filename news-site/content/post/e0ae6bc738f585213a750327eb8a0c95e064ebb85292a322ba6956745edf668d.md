<p>I don’t envy software developers who work on image editors—it must be tough when your biggest competitor has basically become a generic term for the whole category.</p>
<p>But I’ve never been a user of that big fancy image editing app, which has frankly always seemed a bit daunting. (Not to mention it used to be prohibitively expensive for a dabbler like me.) So, for more years than I can remember, when I’ve needed to edit some images—for everything from a simple task like resizing or cropping to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/05/from-cover-to-cover-adventures-in-self-publishing/">creating book covers</a>—I’ve turned to <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Flying Meat’s Acorn</a>. It lets me do everything I need to do at a fraction of the price of many of its competitors.<sup id="fnref-19190-power"><a href="#fn-19190-power" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>

In the case of the former, Acorn is now universal, running on—and fully optimized for—M1 Macs. The same is true for its myriad built-in filters, and in case that’s not enough there are also speed improvements to some common tools, including Flood Fill and the Magic Wand, making them up to three times faster than they used to be.&#8230;</p>
