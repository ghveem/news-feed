  <p id="8xDfmT">Unlike most GPUs in the RTX 3000 series, Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics cards can be relatively compact. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">dual-fan EVGA RTX 3060 XC</a> we reviewed measured just <a href="https://www.evga.com/products/specs/gpu.aspx?pn=716f8f06-ce42-42da-96f5-28429a21ec06">201.8mm long</a>, for example, making it easy to fit in most gaming cases. But if you want something even smaller, Asus has become the latest to announce <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FMotherboards-Components%2FGraphics-Cards%2FPhoenix%2FPH-RTX3060-12G%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356900%2Fasus-rtx-3060-phoenix-single-fan-compact-gpu-announced" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a single-fan RTX 3060 GPU</a> from its Phoenix brand, which is known for making compact desktop GPUs. </p>
<p id="Y2xGYx">Asus’ single-fan GPU is actually the longest single-fan GPU announced so far, at 177mm long (and 2.55-slots wide), while companies like <a href="https://www.gainward.com/main/vgapro.php?id=1108&amp;lang=en">Gainward</a> (170mm), <a href="https://www.palit.com/palit/vgapro.php?id=4107&amp;lang=en&amp;pn=NE63060019K9-190AF&amp;tab=ov">Palit</a> (170mm), and <a href="https://www.msi.com/Graphics-Card/GeForce-RTX-3060-AERO-ITX-12G/Specification">MSI</a> (172mm) have all created more compact single-fan RTX 3060 GPUs that are even slightly shorter and take up only two slots each. Still, the Asus is notably shorter...</p>
