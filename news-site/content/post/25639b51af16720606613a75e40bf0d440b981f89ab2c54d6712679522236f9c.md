<p id="aytwfd">Revealed in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">a leak on Reddit on Wednesday</a>, and then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup/ev-startup-canoo-plans-to-roll-out-american-built-pod-like-electric-pickup-in-2023-idUSKBN2B3010">subsequently confirmed to <em>Reuters</em></a> before officially being revealed, the head-turning EV truck is not due out until 2023. By that time, Tesla’s Cybertruck, the electric Hummer pickup, Ford’s electric F-150, and Rivian’s EV pickup should all be on the road. Canoo said it will start taking preorders for its pickup later this year, but did not release pricing details. The startup is also reportedly in talks with other states for a “microfactory” where a contract manufacturer would build the vehicles. </p>
