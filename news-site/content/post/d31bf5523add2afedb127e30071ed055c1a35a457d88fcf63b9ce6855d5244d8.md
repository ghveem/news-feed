Nuclear fusion has, traditionally, been used as the core scientific principle behind thermonuclear warheads. But the same technology that powers our weapons of mass destruction could, theoretically, be harnessed to power our cities. This would be the first fusion reactor capable of producing more energy than it takes to operate. If we can build and operate fusion reactors safely, we could almost certainly solve the&#8230; <br><br><a href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2021/03/23/scientists-will-test-the-worlds-first-nuclear-fusion-reactor-this-summer/?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web
