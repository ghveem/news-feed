  <p id="tweet-text">Cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS">Daylam Tayari</a> has found evidence in Twitch’s internal API that the site plans to implement something called a “brand safety score” for its streamers. That score would depend on a number of criteria: the streamer’s age, a rating given by Twitch staff, their ban history, the relationship the streamer has with Twitch, their automod settings, their partnership status, the ESRB rating of the game being played, and whether the stream is set to mature. </p>
