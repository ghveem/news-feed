  <p id="kDL5rn">The oft-forgotten <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> has made its way to smartphones, just a few decades after it originally debuted.</p>
<p id="VXT0Mn">Today, Square Enix launched the classic roleplaying game on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-viii-remastered/id1326740784">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFVIII">Android</a>; it’s available for $16.99 right now, but that price will jump to $20.99 starting on April 5th. <em>Final Fantasy VIII </em>first launched on the original PlayStation back in 1999, though this version is the more recent remaster, which hit consoles like the Xbox One, PS4, and Switch in 2019. The game is also available on Steam. In addition to improved visuals, the remaster includes some quality-of-life tweaks, like the option to speed up combat and world exploration.</p>
