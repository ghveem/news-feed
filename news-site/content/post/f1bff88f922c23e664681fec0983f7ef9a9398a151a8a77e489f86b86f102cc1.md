I rely on Shortcuts when I’m working on my iPad, and I’ve written about some of them over the years.</p>
<p>Since I’ve got Shortcuts on the brain thanks to Apple’s issues, I thought I’d quickly list (and share) some of the Shortcuts I use the most, in case readers are interested in seeing how they work and could possibly apply them to their own workflows. (I realize some of these will be extremely specific, since only two people write regularly for Six Colors and I’ve already shared them all with Dan.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/61c0528cf53141f7a0799820f146dedc">Make a Linked List Item</a>.</strong> I frequently find articles I want to link to on Six Colors when I’m on my iPad. In fact, it frequently happens in the morning while I’m still in bed, drinking my tea. I select the text I’d like to quote in my link post on Six Colors, then run this Shortcut from the share menu. The result is sent to 1Writer (you could easily change this step to any text editor of your choice). Of particular note is that I’m using the title of the page as the level-one heading, and I’ve added the URL of the page as a Markdown link named <code>1</code>.&#8230;</p>
