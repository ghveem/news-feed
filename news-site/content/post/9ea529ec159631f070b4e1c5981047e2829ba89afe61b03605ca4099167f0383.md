  <p id="p9TSLm">Google will not introduce a 60 minute call limit on free Google Meet users at the end of March, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499">announced in a tweet</a>. Instead, it will now be begin on June 30th. Until then, anyone using the service’s free version will be able to host calls up to 24 hours in length, which Google refers to as “unlimited.”</p>
<p id="zVZlQj">This is the second time Google has pushed back the introduction of call limits since opening up the service to free users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail">last April</a>. A 60 minute limit had originally been due to come into effect at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom">end of September</a>, but that deadline was later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021">pushed back to March</a> when it became clear that many of us wouldn’t be able to celebrate the holidays in person with our loved ones.</p>
