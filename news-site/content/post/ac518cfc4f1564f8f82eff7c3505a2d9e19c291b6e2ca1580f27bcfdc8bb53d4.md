<p>There’s been a beta version of Photoshop that runs native on the Apple M1 processor since the early days of the Apple silicon era, but on Wednesday <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/10/adobe-photoshop-ships-on-macs-with-apple-silicon-gains-speedier-selections-filters-and-performance-boosts.html#gs.v7cndh">Adobe released the official version</a>, version 22.3.0. As Pam Clark of Adobe writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Starting today, Photoshop runs natively on Macs powered by the M1 chip and takes advantage of the performance improvements built into this new architecture. Our internal tests show a wide range of features running an average of 1.5X the speed of similarly configured previous generation systems. Our tests covered a broad scope of activities, including opening and saving files, running filters, and compute-heavy operations like Content-Aware Fill and Select Subject, which all feel noticeably faster. Our early benchmarking also shows that some operations are substantially faster with the new chip.

Adobe does say that a few bleeding-edge features—Invite to Edit Cloud Documents and Preset Syncing—aren’t currently in the M1 version of Photoshop. Users who rely on those features will need to launch the app in Rosetta 2 instead.</p>
