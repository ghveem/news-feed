  <p id="XvuOCr">George R.R. Martin, the author of the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> book series that was turned into HBO’s smash hit <em>Game of Thrones</em>, has signed a huge new deal with HBO to make content for the network and HBO Max, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-signs-massive-five-year-overall-deal-with-hbo-exclusive">according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. It’s a five-year deal worth “mid-eight figures,” sources told <em>THR.</em></p>
<p id="QnEdEi">Although <em>Game of Thrones </em>ended in 2019, HBO owner WarnerMedia has already announced a prequel series, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067850/house-of-the-dragon-hbo-game-of-thrones-prequel-premiere-2022"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a><em>, </em>based on Martin’s 2019 book <em>Fire and Blood. </em>And there are five projects in development based on the <em>Game of Thrones</em> universe, <em>THR </em>reports. Martin is also developing series for HBO based on the novels <em>Who Fears Death </em>and <em>Roadmarks.</em></p>
<p id="FVoTVk">My worst fear, though, is that this huge new deal keeps Martin from working on...</p>
