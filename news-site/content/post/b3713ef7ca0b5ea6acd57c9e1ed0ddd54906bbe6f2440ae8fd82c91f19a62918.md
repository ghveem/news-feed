  <p id="Ah6puc">“The world has gone terminally insane,” Monty Python’s John Cleese told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/nfts-are-driving-stunts-and-diving-into-the-culture-wars"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> on the topic of getting into NFTs. So naturally, the comic actor known for silly walks is now selling a ludicrously expensive NFT of his own: a Vonnegut-esque drawing of the Brooklyn Bridge made on an iPad Pro. <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x9201a886740d193e315f1f1b2b193321d6701d07/1021">It’s listed on OpenSea</a> and the auction ends in 10 days.</p>
<p id="X2GMfB">Bidding started at $100 and has now made its way up to nearly $36,000. Cleese won’t let his masterpiece go for that cheap, though. Cleese said he wants $69.3 million for the piece, suggesting the illustration won’t sell unless someone bids at least that much. </p>
