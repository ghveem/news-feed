  <p id="iUh0l6">Some Android apps are crashing for some people right now, but Google is working on a fix. The issue is due to a system component <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview">called Android System WebView</a> that lets Android apps display web content, but it has some kind of problem right now that is causing apps to crash. </p>
<p id="ODHH6q">“We are aware of an issue with WebView causing some apps on Android to crash for some users,” Google said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We are currently working to fully validate the scope and a fix is in progress.” </p>
<p id="sUFqjV">Some users are saying that <a href="https://twitter.com/19Watty87/status/1374130850518945798">removing</a> the latest update to WebView should fix the issue — and in fact, Samsung’s official US support Twitter account recommends <a href="https://twitter.com/milanbear0609/status/1374122986870083584">taking that exact step</a>. </p>
