  <p id="3D5o6F">A sealed copy of the NES classic <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sold for an incredible $660,000 at Heritage Auctions on Friday, more than quadrupling the previous record for the most expensive game ever. </p>
<p id="y56MAL">This isnâ€™t the first time <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> has held the record: a mint copy of the US version of the game sold for $114,000 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever">in July 2020</a> (which broke the record of $100,150 set by <em>another</em> copy of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18225317/mint-copy-super-mario-bros-100150-auction">in February 2019</a>). In November, however, a different title set a new record: a sealed copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> sold for $156,000, making it the most expensive video game ever sold until today. </p>
<p id="tCTdLe">Here is what makes the version of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that sold today so special, <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/super-mario-bros-wata-96-a-sealed-hangtab-1-code-mid-production-nes-nintendo-1985-usa/a/7242-93028.s?type=bidnotice-tracked-dailystatus">according to Heritage Auctions</a>:</p>
