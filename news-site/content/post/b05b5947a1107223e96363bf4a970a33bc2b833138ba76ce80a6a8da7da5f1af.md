  <p id="pOWcIe">Lenovo isn’t a major player in the gaming chair scene, but its <em>Demon Slayer</em>-themed creation shows that it could easily dice up the competition if it chose to. Per <a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-themed-gaming-chair-has-a-katana-holder-1846510944"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, the company has made a limited edition chair that has a holstered katana built onto its side. But before you imagine spinning around in the chair with a sword out, there’s sadly no katana in the holster. Is it false advertising to make a <em>Demon Slayer</em> chair with which you can’t actually slay demons? </p>
<p id="KfRU90">Doubly sad is that you can’t buy the chair. Only five are being made <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fjp%2Fja%2Flandings%2Fkimetsu_sns2&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F19%2F22340795%2Flenovo-demon-slayer-anime-gaming-chair-katana-japan-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">for a giveaway promo in Japan</a>. Hey, if you live in Japan, follow Lenovo of Japan’s Twitter account, then retweet a tweet, and try to win this chair on behalf of us all.</p>
