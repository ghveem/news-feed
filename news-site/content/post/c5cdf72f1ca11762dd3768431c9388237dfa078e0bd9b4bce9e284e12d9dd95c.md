  <p id="V2LxXv">A rare prototype of a Leica camera crafted by former Apple luminary Jony Ive and famed designer Marc Newson is being <a href="https://www.leitz-auction.com/auction/en/auktion34/auction38/article/243.html">sold at auction in June</a>. The device, which is described as being in “B+” condition, has a starting price of €100.000 (around $118,000), and the Leitz Photographica Auction house estimates that it’ll sell for between €200.000 and €250.000 (around $235,000 to $295,000).</p>
<p id="oYBEe1">The prototype was produced during the development of the one-off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity">Leica M for (RED)</a> camera, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5140200/jony-ive-and-marc-newsons-red-charity-auction-raises-26-million">sold at a charity auction in 2013 for $1.8 million</a>. While the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity">final product’s design</a> shared a lot of similarities with Apple’s “cheesegrater” Mac Pro, this prototype appears to have a smooth reflective finish that looks like an absolute fingerprint magnet. </p>
