<p>Creative Commons is proud to announce the launch of “Open Educational Resources for Librarians and Educators,” our first professional development microcredential course and partnership with the University of Nebraska at Omaha, commencing on 31 May. This microcredential pilot started with one CC Certificate alumnus’s enthusiasm for open education. Craig Finlay, OER and STEM Librarian at&#8230;</p>
