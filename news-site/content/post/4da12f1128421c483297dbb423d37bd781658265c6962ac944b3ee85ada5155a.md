  <p id="Yrk4Q0">Sony’s “<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/83ccec1a-8c8e-4ef7-bb02-ba0fdf042e6c/1">Play at Home</a>” initiative continues with a huge stack of excellent games, including <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission </em>and <em>Subnautica</em>, that are free to own for a limited time. No PlayStation Plus membership is required, meaning you can keep these games forever. </p>
<p id="nS2gG1">From now through April 22nd at 11:59PM PT, the following titles will be free to claim for PS4 and PS5 users: <em>ABZÛ,</em> <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>,<em> Rez Infinite, Subnautica,</em> <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em>, <em>Moss</em>, <em>Thumper</em>, and <em>Paper Beast</em>. The last four games require a PSVR headset to play. PS5 owners will need a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/">PlayStation Camera adapter</a> to use the headset with the console. </p>
<p id="l9VpIQ">Sony plans to offer more games as part of the initiative until sometime in June. Currently, Sony is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus">offering <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a>,...</p>
