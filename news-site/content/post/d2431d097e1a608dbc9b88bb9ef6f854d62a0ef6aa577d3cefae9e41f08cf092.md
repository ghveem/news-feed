  <p id="IbU69i">Disney is <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-media-and-entertainment-distribution-announces-updates-to-summer-film-release-schedule">moving</a> two of its biggest 2021 releases to streaming: <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Cruella</em> are now set to debut on <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Disney Plus</a> as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. Additionally, <em>Black Widow</em> has been delayed an additional two months: it’ll now debut in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 9th, instead of the previous May 7th release date. (<em>Cruella</em> is still set to release on May 28th.) </p>
<p id="5106iu">Additionally, Disney announced further changes to its schedule: Pixar’s <em>Luca</em> will now be skipping theaters entirely (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters">similar to last year’s <em>Soul</em></a>) and will release on <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Disney Plus</a> for all subscribers with no additional fee on June 18th. </p>
