Semiconductors are the logic and memory chips used in computers, phones, vehicles, and appliances. The U.S. share of global semiconductor fabrication is only 12%, down from 37% in 1990, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. It might not seem important that 88% of the semiconductor chips used by U.S. industries, including the automotive and defense industries, are fabricated outside the U.S. However, three issues make where they are made critical to the U.S.&#8230; <br><br><a href="https://thenextweb.com/tech/2021/03/14/global-semiconductor-shortage-hitting-the-us-syndication/?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web
