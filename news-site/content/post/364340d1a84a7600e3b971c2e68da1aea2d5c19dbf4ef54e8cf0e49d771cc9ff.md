  <p id="jB1tF0"><a href="https://www.lg.com/de/android-updates">LG’s German</a> website has revealed its Android 11 update roadmap — at least for Europe — and the news isn’t too encouraging. With the exception of the LG Velvet 5G, most of the company’s phones won’t get Android 11 until the back half of 2021, with the vast majority of devices not seeing the update until at least Q4 2021 (long after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel">Android <em>12</em></a> should be available, if Google’s release schedule is similar this year). </p>
<p id="98aXQk">It’s worth noting that the released schedule is only from LG’s German site. It’s possible that time frames will be different in other regions, that LG could add more devices over time, or that the updates will simply take less time to develop than the company expects. </p>
