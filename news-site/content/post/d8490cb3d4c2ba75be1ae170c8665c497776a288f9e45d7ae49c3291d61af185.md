  <p id="sZ741t">T-Mobile will soon put a new privacy policy into effect that will allow it to share certain kinds of customer information with third-party advertisers. Starting on April 26th, 2021, all customers will be automatically opted in to the new program, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803?mod=djemalertNEWS">spotted by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Customers who don’t want to participate will need to manually opt out using their accounts’ <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">privacy tools</a>.</p>
<p id="l0R5BD">T-Mobile’s new policy is no different than <a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/privacy/overview.html">AT&amp;T</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-32&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Verizon’s</a>.
