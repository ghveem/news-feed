  <p id="i7pWNZ">GameStop stock (GME) soared in value on Wednesday, peaking at $348.50 per share. Then, in an event that’s <em>definitely</em> not cause for concern, minutes later it lost fully half its value by plummeting to $172, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/gamestop-s-winning-streak-keeps-going-amid-cohen-shakeup-plan?sref=vuYGislZ"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>.<em> </em>Yes, “stonks” are back, and GameStop is once again <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility">in the crosshairs of online amateur investors</a>.</p>
<p id="B0TRQF">Wednesday’s drama ultimately ended with the price settling back down to $265 per share, but it’s hard to not feel déjà vu. It seems like it was only yesterday when everyone was watching in a mixture of shock, amusement, and general concern as GME crested $483 per share. The rise and fall doesn’t quite compare, but the losses for anyone who sold during Wednesday’s dip in price are likely huge.</p>
