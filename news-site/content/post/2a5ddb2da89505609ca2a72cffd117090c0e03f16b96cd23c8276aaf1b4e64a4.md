<p>A few years ago, I switched from Chrome back to Safari, wanting a more fluid experience between my Macs and iOS devices. While I now enjoy having my bookmarks, tabs and history everywhere I go — as long as iCloud is working — there is one Chrome feature that I wish Safari would swipe: multiple profiles.</p>

This comes with a bunch of obvious potential benefits.</p>
<p>If you want to use Chrome for both personal and work browsing, creating a separate profile for each means you can be logged into the same website with multiple accounts but never accidentally be in the wrong one. As someone who uses Gmail for both personal and work email, this can be a real lifesaver. You can also keep work bookmarks and history separate, keeping your personal data nice and tidy.</p>
<p>This is basically how I use this Chrome feature. I have my main account, which has a few bookmarks for things I prefer to do in Chrome, but then two additional ones.</p>
<p>The “Relay” profile is a pretty basic one that is logged into a specific Google account for using the admin tools for <a href="https://podcasts.google.com">Google Podcasts.</a>&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>
