  <p id="b1Wc5T">A new season of <em>Fortnite</em> is almost here, which can only mean one thing: a big in-game event. Today, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/play-the-zero-crisis-finale-in-chapter-2-season-6">Epic detailed what players can expect</a> when season 6 of <em>Fortnite</em>’s second chapter kicks off. It sounds pretty ambitious and even includes a story-focused solo experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="JKkCxC">Chapter 2 Season 6 launches on March 16th with the explosive conclusion of the events of season 5. When you first launch into the new season, you’ll play through the conclusion of Agent Jones’ mission in the Zero Crisis Finale. The aftermath of this event is sure to shape reality as we know it.</p>
<p id="Eaaa9C">Don’t worry, the Zero Crisis Finale is a solo experience and you can play through it whenever...</p>
