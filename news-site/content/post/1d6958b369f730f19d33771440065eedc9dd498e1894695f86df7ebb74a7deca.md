  <p id="tweet-text">Acting NASA administrator Steve Jurczyk said Friday that under President Biden’s budget request, the agency’s Artemis mission has a new goal: in addition to landing the first woman on the Moon, it will also send the first person of color to the lunar surface. So far, the only Earthlings to touch the Moon’s surface have been white men. </p>
<p id="RfgyZF">“The president’s discretionary request increases NASA’s ability to better understand Earth and further monitor and predict the impacts of climate change,” <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/acting-nasa-administrator-statement-on-agency-fy-2022-discretionary-request">Jurczyk said in a statement</a>. “It also gives us the necessary resources to continue advancing America’s bipartisan Moon to Mars space exploration plan, including landing the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under the Artemis program.”</p>
