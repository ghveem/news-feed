  <p id="U0GroO">Two Coinbase employees have managed to find a heartwarming use for NFTs by incorporating them into their wedding, exchanging the digital tokens as part of the ceremony. </p>
<p id="fQFORx">Rebecca Rose and Peter Kacherginsky <a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014366923071490">say that alongside their traditional Jewish ceremony</a>, the couple also sent each other digital tokens as “virtual rings” to each other. In <a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014389710712837">a Twitter thread</a> about the wedding, Rose said that their virtual rings now exist on the blockchain “for all to see as proof of our commitment to each other.”</p>
