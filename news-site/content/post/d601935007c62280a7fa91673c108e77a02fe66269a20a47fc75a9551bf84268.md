  <p id="pPW2l6"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>’<em> </em>already robust design tools are getting some improvements with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/free-update-for-animal-crossing-new-horizons-delivers-new-content/">a free update</a> hitting March 18th. One new addition is a big upgrade to the NookPhone’s design app that will let you customize umbrellas, small flags, uchiwa fans, and photo stands.</p>
<p id="binxxf">The app already let you make designs for shirts, dresses, and hats, so with the upgrade, you’ll be able to tailor an even more custom look (and make a fun photo stand while you’re at it). The upgraded app will also add 50 design slots to both the normal and Pro custom design modes, allowing you to create and save even more designs than before.</p>
