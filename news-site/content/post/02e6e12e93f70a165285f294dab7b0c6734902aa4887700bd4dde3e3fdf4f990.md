  <p id="7u1DyK">If you’re on a basic Verizon plan, you’re going to be stuck with the company’s poor performing “nationwide” 5G network — even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0JNCwmCmCg">presentation to investors</a> and confirmed to <em>The Verge </em>that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on “premium” unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS "nationwide" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  <a href="https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI">https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI</a></p>— Eli Blumenthal...</blockquote>
