As childhood friends studying at Chalmers, Arta Mandegari and Salman Eskandari gave free maths lessons to disadvantaged children from Gothenburg&#8217;s suburbs. After brief business careers, they reunited in 2015 to form Albert, a portfolio of apps offering curriculum-based digital resources and individualised homework help. Since October 2021, Albert has been listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market.
