  <p id="vhTjQN">LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business">mobile industry exit</a>, announced last week. <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"><em>Phone Arena</em></a> spotted the <a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441">updated FAQ</a>, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. </p>
<p id="XoiLYB">According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. </p>
