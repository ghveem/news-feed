  <p id="eXFOAD">The first trailer for <em>Exposure</em> — the upcoming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362153/samsung-s21-ultra-hulu-exposure-show-branded-content">Samsung-branded reality TV show</a> from Hulu that’s one part photography competition, one part Galaxy S21 Ultra advertisement — is here. But for a show that’s been paid for by Samsung explicitly to highlight the power of the cameras on Samsung’s phones, it’s almost <em>suspiciously</em> light on Samsung branding. </p>
<p id="lciBi9">If you just gave <em>Exposure</em> a cursory glance (or, more likely, stumbled across it on Hulu one night) there’s nothing about it that immediately betrays its status as Samsung branded content. There’s no Samsung logo on the title card, no mention of the Galaxy S21 Ultra or its 108-megapixel camera system, or the various software add-ons that help Samsung’s smartphone stand out from the rest.</p>
