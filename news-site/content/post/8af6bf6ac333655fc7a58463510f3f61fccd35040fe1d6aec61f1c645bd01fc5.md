  <p id="WKPmx8">Facebook is introducing a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/more-control-and-context-in-news-feed/">handful of new features</a> that will give users greater control over their News Feed, including an easier way to turn off the feed’s algorithmic ranking and display content in the order it was posted instead.  </p>
<p id="omj2Gn">The changes build on previous tweaks to News Feed functionality. Last October, Facebook introduced a “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778">Favorites</a>” tool that allows users to select up to thirty friends and pages, prioritizing their content or displaying it in a separate feed. The company also offers users the option to sort their feeds by “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/218728138156311">most recent</a>,” but buries these options in obscure menus.</p>
<p id="CEnExx">Facebook is now making these “Favorites” and “Recent” filters much more prominent, putting them right at the top of the News Feed as separate tabs...</p>
