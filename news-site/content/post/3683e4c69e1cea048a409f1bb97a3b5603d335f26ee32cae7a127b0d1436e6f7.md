  <p id="4RFZqA">Sony has, in a very low-key way, just announced that its upcoming Xperia event will be on April 14th (<a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/04/01/sony-xperia-announcement-scheduled-for-april-14/">via D<em>roid Life</em></a>). The news comes from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SonyXperia/featured">Xperia YouTube channel’s</a> banner, where it lays out that there will be a new product announcement happening at 4:30PM Japan Standard Time — that’s 3:30AM EST, or 12:30AM PT (if you feel like burning the midnight oil to watch live). </p>
<p id="mCpQFG">The banner gives no real hints as to what will be announced, but there have been a few rumors floating around — one about a new flagship, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254722/sony-xperia-1-iii-leak-periscope-camera">the Xperia 1 III</a>, and one about the return of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248890/sony-xperia-compact-2021-android-phone-leak-rumor-size">Xperia Compact</a>, which could end up being an Android answer to the iPhone Mini. </p>

<p id="PUguwx">It’s worth noting that there are <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-launch-1214221/">other rumors</a> that mention new versions...</p>
