But what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from Tesla, <em>The Verge </em>has learned.</p>
<p id="ym0hqc">The newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 2020, according to <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412130/Attachment_C___Applicant_s_Narrative_of_Project.pdf">documents</a> <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412167/Item_No__4_.pdf">submitted</a> last <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412129/Item_No__3_.pdf">year</a>. It will consist of 85 Tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino. Monterey County’s planning chief confirmed that Apple will use the Tesla batteries in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. Apple declined to comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
