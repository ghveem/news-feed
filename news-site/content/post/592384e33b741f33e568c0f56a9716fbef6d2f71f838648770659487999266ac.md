  <p id="oiVLTU">Motorola <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fhello-moto-g100&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350611%2Fmotorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">has unveiled the G100 and G50</a>, two midrange phones headed first for European and Latin American markets.
