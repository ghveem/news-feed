  <p id="HSEB4h"><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/3/31/a-new-way-to-celebrate-with-robinhood">Robinhood is cutting out the confetti</a> from its stock trading app, following accusations that the animation helped to “gamify” investing. Instead, the company is adding new animations that will celebrate trading milestones for users in a more somber manner. </p>
<p id="pf00Aw">The celebratory digital confetti showers have been a controversial part of Robinhood’s app since 2016. In the past, Robinhood has argued that the friendly features “help investing fit easily into people’s lives.” But others — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-regulators-to-file-complaint-against-robinhood-11608120003?mod=article_inline">including the Massachusetts Securities Division</a> — have argued that the confetti (along with other features, like free stock promotions) help to “gamify” stock trading for amateur investors who may not understand what they’re getting into. </p>
