  <p id="HbAndJ">Vast amounts of ancient Martian water may have been buried beneath its surface instead of escaping into space, scientists report in the journal <em>Science</em>. The findings, published Tuesday, may help untangle a clash of theories seeking to explain the disappearance of Mars’ water, a resource that was abundant on the planet’s surface billions of years ago.</p>
<p id="r88HBW">Through modeling and data from Mars probes, rovers, and meteorites, researchers at the California Institute of Technology found that a broad range — between 30 to 99 percent — of the Red Planet’s earliest amounts of water could have vanished from the surface through a geological process called crustal hydration, where water was locked away in the rocks<em> </em>of Mars.</p>
