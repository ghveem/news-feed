  <p id="pJ90Sj">Apple released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXl6KtP9TFw">new trailer for <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s second season</a> on Monday ahead of its May 7th debut. The trailer doesn’t feature many specific plot points, though it looks like we’ll be seeing how Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work together on a new expansion now that they’re co-creative directors on the fictional game. Things between them seem good, at least at the beginning.</p>

He also made an appearance in a motion-capture suit in <a href="https://youtu.be/vHVknNT_Bmw">the season 2 teaser trailer</a>, so here’s hoping he has a notable role of some kind.</p>
