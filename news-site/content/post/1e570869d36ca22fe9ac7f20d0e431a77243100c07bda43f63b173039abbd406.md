  <p id="qDRwsd">Microsoft Teams is currently down worldwide. Microsoft says it’s attempting to bring the service back online after “a recent change to an authentication system” took some Microsoft 365 services down. While a roll back to the change has taken longer than Microsoft expected, it’s now complete and Teams, Azure, and other Microsoft 365 services should be coming back online.</p>
<p id="xAD6y0">The issues started around 3:30PM ET, and Microsoft quickly confirmed they are affecting users worldwide. This is the first major Microsoft Teams outage since the service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492688/microsoft-outlook-office-teams-azure-outage-down">went down back in September</a>, alongside other Microsoft 365 services like Office 365 and Outlook. Microsoft also blamed its previous outage on a configuration change. </p>
