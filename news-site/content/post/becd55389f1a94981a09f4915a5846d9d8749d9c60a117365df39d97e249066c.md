<p>My thanks to Rogue Amoeba, the very first Six Colors sponsor, for once again sponsoring Six Colors this week!</p>
<p>Rogue Amoeba’s Mac utility <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/sentBy.php?six1">Loopback</a> makes it trivial to pass audio from one application to another on your Mac. Whether that’s playing a recording into Zoom, adding sound effects into a podcast, or include music into a streamed event, Loopback gives you the power to do it with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Loopback’s magic is that it creates <em>virtual</em> audio devices, which merge audio from multiple applications and input devices into a single source. Then you can just select them in any audio app on your Mac. It’s incredibly powerful. And Loopback’s intuitive wire-based interface makes it easy to understand what sound is flowing where.</p>
<p>I use Loopback for podcasts (letting me play a live soundboard for my guests), and for live streaming tabletop gaming on YouTube (mixing my microphone with the <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/sentBy.php?sixzoom">output of a Zoom call</a>). Loopback can probably help you, too. Through April 30, Six Colors readers can <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/sentBy.php?six1">save 21% with coupon code SIXLB</a>.&#8230;</p>
