  <p id="cXyBDB">Bang and Olufsen’s latest connected speaker is the Emerge. Its thin form-factor should blend right in to most bookshelves, and that’s no accident. In a press release <a href="https://press.bang-olufsen.com/d/gKpSDxqk8eyT/news#/april-2021/bang-olufsen-introduces-beosound-emerge-an-incredibly-slim-yet-powerful-home-speaker">announcing the speaker</a>, the company says its design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book” with side panels that wrap around like a cover, and a logo on the front that’s meant to evoke a title printed on the spine. </p>
<p id="seJuu6">It’s a nice contrast from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9470909/40000-speaker-bang-olufsen">some</a> of Bang and Olufsen’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17795192/bang-olufsen-edge-speaker-price-release-date-ifa-2018">previous speakers</a>, which have had huge, hulking form-factors that are hard to imagine in any normal home. Instead, the Emerge takes a similar approach to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound">Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers</a>, which have pulled double duty as lamps or shelving to help them blend in with the rest of your furniture.</p>
