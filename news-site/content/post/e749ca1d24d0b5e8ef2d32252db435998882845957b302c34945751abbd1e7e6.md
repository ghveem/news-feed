It’s a render showing off the kinds of design features the company will use in its upcoming true wireless earbuds, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274087/nothing-carl-pei-true-wireless-headphones-smart-devices-summer">debut product due for release</a> this summer. It was designed by Tom Howard, the company’s head of design who also serves as vice head of design at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones">Nothing’s partner Teenage Engineering</a>.</p>
