  <p id="nvPKq1">Nintendo has announced <em>Pac-Man 99</em>, a new multiplayer game that’ll be included with its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service. Like <em>Tetris 99</em> and the recently departed <em>Super Mario Bros. 35</em>, the game pits dozens of players against each other in a battle royale-style fight to the end.</p>
<p id="SPcVGU">The game looks similar to the classic arcade original Pac-Man, but you can make it more difficult for opponents by munching on power pellets, eating ghosts, and sending “Jammer Pac-Man” over to their screens. There are eight different preset strategies you can use to screw with other players, for example by speeding up their game.</p>
