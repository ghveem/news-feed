<p>My thanks to BZG Apps for sponsoring Six Colors this week. BZG makes <a href="http://bzgapps.com/sixcolors">Unite 4</a>, which allows you to turn any Website into a Mac app. Using a lightweight, WebKit powered browser as a backend, you can easily create isolated, customizable apps from any site.</p>
<p>Unite 4 includes dozens of new features, including support for native notifications, new customization options, and M1 support. Unite apps also serve as a great alternative for resource-hogging Electron apps or half-baked Catalyst apps.</p>
<p>Six Colors readers get 20% off this week when you purchase Unite 4 at <a href="http://bzgapps.com/sixcolors">http://bzgapps.com/sixcolors</a> or when using the promo code <code>SixColors</code> at checkout. There’s also a 14 day free trial, and the app is included in <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/unite?utm_campaign=unite_main_banner&#38;utm_content=banner&#38;utm_medium=vendor_program&#38;utm_source=unite">Setapp</a> for subscribers.&#8230;</p>
