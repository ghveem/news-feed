  <p id="vU7xI9">Did you know that you could mute all system audio by simply holding the mute button on the DualSense for about one second? I’ve had a PS5 for months, yet I only now realized this hidden feature exists after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzw4DQT0qzs">watching a YouTube video</a> that the algorithm served me. You’ll know it’s working when the orange mute light strobes softly, then you won’t hear any system sounds.</p>
<p id="cQnHg4">Apparently, this trick works to disable all audio, no matter the audio source, be it your speakers, headphones wired into the controller’s 3.5mm jack, a wireless gaming headset, or one plugged in via one of the console’s USB ports. Even though the DualSense has some limited PC support, this feature is exclusive to PS5, it seems.</p>
