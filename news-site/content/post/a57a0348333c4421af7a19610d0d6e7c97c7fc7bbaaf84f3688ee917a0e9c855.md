  <p id="t5p29N">Gogo will be delaying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18644707/gogo-5g-network-planes-developing-in-flight">the rollout of its 5G network</a>, pushing it back from 2021 to 2022. <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/gogo-delays-5g-launch-due-to-chipset-shortages/d/d-id/768025">According to <em>LightReading</em></a>, the global chip shortage is to blame for the delay, though Gogo didn’t provide any direct details about how the shortage was setting it back.</p>

The situation has gotten to the point where President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation">has signed an executive order</a> calling for a review of the chip supply chain.</p>
