In other words: We live inside a computer that learns. The big idea: Bostrom’s Simulation Argument has been a hot topic in science circles lately. We published “What if you’re living in a simulation, but there’s no computer” recently to posit a different theory, but Microsoft’s pulled a cosmic “hold my beer” with this paper. Dubbed “The Autodidactic Universe,” and published to arXiv today, the paper spans 80 pages and lays out a pretty good&#8230; <br><br><a href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2021/04/09/physicists-working-with-microsoft-think-the-universe-is-a-self-learning-computer/?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br/><br/>Or just read more coverage about: <a href='https://thenextweb.com/company/microsoft/'>Microsoft</a>
