  <p id="wz0tme">Facebook and Instagram were down on Thursday afternoon. The outage appeared to start around 5:30PM ET, with several thousand people <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/">reporting outages</a> on DownDetector. The outage is the second one in less than a month from the social media giant; an outage on March 19th took its sites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340405/instagram-whatsapp-facebook-messenger-down-outage">offline for several hours</a>. Facebook returned a “sorry something went wrong” error message:</p>

<p id="dySLEl">The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em> on the cause of the outage; it’s unclear at this time when service will be fully restored. The outage appeared to affect Facebook’s internal websites as well, first noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1380274375757242368">tweet from develope</a>r Jane Wong. Even Facebook’s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/status/dashboard/">outage dashboard</a> appeared to be having problems. </p>
