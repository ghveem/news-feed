  <p id="qGpu6o">Last Friday, the Fagradalsfjall volcano near Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/19/iceland-volcano-eruption-under-way-in-fagradalsfjall-near-reykjavik">began erupting</a> for the first time in 800 years after the island nation was hit by thousands of small earthquakes. Thankfully, the eruption was small and has not put anyone in danger. Instead, it’s gifted the world with some awe-inspiring views of lava flowing from the ground.</p>
<p id="6N2qd6">The sight has been best captured by Icelandic drone pilot Bjorn Steinbekk, who took the straightforward approach of flying right through the eruption. We spotted the footage from Steinbekk (above) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyQuintano/status/1373787472493170695">via Twitter</a>, and it seems he flew several sorties through the airborne lava — a daring feat that makes us wonder how his drone survived the high temperatures.</p>
