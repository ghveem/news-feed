<p>To understand the desperation Apple felt in the mid-to-late 1990s, look no further than to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&#38;url=https://twitter.com/kevinpurcell/status/1111765780855554050&#38;xcust=1-1-340370-0-0-0&#38;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/340370/an-act-of-desperation-20-years-ago-formed-the-building-block-for-the-modern-mac.html">one particular t-shirt</a>. On the front was a 3-D rendered numeral eight. On the back, the words “Hands-On Experience” and Mac OS 8 logo.</p>
<p>At Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June 1996, many of us got to experience the future of the Mac for the first time. We got the t-shirt for test driving Apple’s transformational new operating system, one that replaced the woefully out-of-date classic Mac OS with something that could compete with Microsoft. The operating system was nicknamed Copland and it never shipped. The “Hands-On Experience” shirts and an accompanying book, “Mac OS 8 Revealed,” were as good it was ever going to get.</p>
<p>With its back against the wall and its internal software development failing, Apple was left with only desperation moves. Fortunately, it made a good one, resulting in <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1014500/12xpreview.html">Mac OS X 10.0</a>, which shipped 20 years ago this week.&#8230;</p>
