  <p id="XVmATT">Today is “MAR10 Day,” and although it is not Mario’s “birthday” (which is September 13th), this day usually has some of the best deals on games published by Nintendo. Nintendo rarely discounts its first-party games, so if you recently purchased a Switch and want to stock up on some games, today is a good day to expand your game library.</p>
<p id="rPa1fQ">Several retailers — including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mario+bros+Switch+games&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://shop-links.co/1734509568504630408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fcollection%2Fmario-bros" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GameStop</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnintendo-switch-games%2F2636_4646529_4234943&amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Walmart</a> — are slashing the prices of some Nintendo games, with up to $21 in savings available. Most of the games feature the mustachioed plumber, some of which are available for $39, such as <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Odyssey-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F967828360&amp;subid1=VergeDeals03092021&amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fmario-tennis-aces%2F10157967.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mario Tennis Aces</em></a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1005868/9383?subId1=VergeDeals031021&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNew-Super-Mario-Bros-U-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592691%2F214311136&amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>New Super Mario Bros.
