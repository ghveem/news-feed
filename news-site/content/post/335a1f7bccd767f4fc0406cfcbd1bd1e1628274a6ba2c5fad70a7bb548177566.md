  <p id="4hB9rh">Amazon, Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, and Facebook have joined hundreds of corporations, executives, and celebrities in signing a public letter today supporting voting rights and condemning legislation that would “restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/ceos-corporate-america-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a>.</p>
<p id="50cX9m">The public letter appeared as a full-page ad in <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post </em>on Wednesday and was organized by former American Express credit card company executive Kenneth Chenault, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, and the Black Economic Alliance. You can see an image of the ad, <a href="https://twitter.com/dgelles/status/1382293992705028100?s=20">shared by <em>NYT</em> reporter David Gelles</a>, below: </p>
