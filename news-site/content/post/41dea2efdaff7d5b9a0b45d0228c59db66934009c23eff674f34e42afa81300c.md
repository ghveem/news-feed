  <p id="r8U7yG">USB-C ports, I am occasionally forced to admit, are somewhat confusing. Different standards, different charging speeds, different data and video capabilities, proprietary labels like Thunderbolt, all on top of identical-looking plugs — it can be a lot.</p>
<p id="uj9Xu9">But one thing that USB-C ports had going for them was a solution for one of the biggest annoyances of USB-A — it’s no longer possible to insert a USB cable the “wrong” way, thanks to the symmetrical design of the plugs.</p>
<p id="Qu8Vph">Or, at least, it <em>was</em>, until mechanical engineer Pim de Groot came along with a USB-C gadget from hell, which <em>does</em> behave differently depending on which way your USB-C plug is facing. And I hate it so, so much. </p>
