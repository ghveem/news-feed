  <p id="EJirpl">Parallels is releasing an update to its Desktop virtual machine software that allows M1 Mac owners to install Windows 10 on Arm. Parallels Desktop 16.5 now includes the necessary native support to run the Arm version of Windows on M1 chips, following Apple’s decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp">not to support Boot Camp on M1 Macs</a>. </p>
<p id="c9rHvi">The latest version of Parallels Desktop for Mac now allows M1 Mac owners to run Windows 10 on Arm apps or traditional x86 apps side by side with Mac or iOS apps on Big Sur. There will be some app limitations on the Windows 10 on Arm side, thanks to its own app emulation, but Windows 10 on Arm will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495510/microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation">soon support x64 app emulation</a>, too.</p>
