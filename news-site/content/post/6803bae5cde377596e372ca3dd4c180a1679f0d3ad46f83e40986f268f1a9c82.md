  <p id="Vp4D1N"><em>Time</em> is the latest brand <a href="https://time.com/5948741/time-nft-covers/">to jump on the NFT craze</a>, with auctions for three magazine covers — including its iconic 1966 front page asking, “<a href="https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/time-is-god-dead-21612">Is God Dead?</a>” A more recent spin on the cover, “<a href="https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/time-is-truth-dead-21650">Is Truth Dead?</a>” from 2017, is also up for auction, as is a brand-new “cover” that’s not actually appearing on the magazine: “<a href="https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/time-is-fiat-dead-21652">Is Fiat Dead?</a>” — a phrase that sounds like catnip for the type of crypto enthusiasts likely to bid on these things.</p>
<p id="uusByy">The three covers are selling on the NFT auction site SuperRare, with bids running through Wednesday evening. A minimum price of 10 Ether, or close to $18,000 USD, has been set for each cover. The “Fiat” cover is already at double that as of press time.</p>
