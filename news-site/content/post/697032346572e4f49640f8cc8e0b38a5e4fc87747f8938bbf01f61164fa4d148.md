  <p id="UbXIal">A third phone in the upcoming OnePlus 9 series has been confirmed by the company’s CEO, in <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/tech/exclusive-oneplus-9r-signals-return-of-the-flagship-killer-gaming-credentials-and-made-for-india-3547673.html">an interview with <em>News18</em></a> (<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/18/oneplus-ceo-confirms-affordably-priced-oneplus-9r-coming-to-india/">via <em>Android Police</em></a>). The announcement, which is coming just five days before the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras">OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are set to be fully revealed</a>, confirms rumors that OnePlus would also be announcing a less expensive phone in addition to its new flagships. So far, though, the phone is only confirmed to be coming to India.</p>
<p id="yJZe5R">In the interview, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau says that the company wants “to go even further” than it did with the OnePlus Nord, in regards to the included tech and design. Depending on how closely you follow OnePlus, you may remember the Nord as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled">mid-range phone that was available in Europe and India</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review">as a budget phone...</a></p>
