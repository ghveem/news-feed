  <p id="WfNhlU">Alongside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22131848">Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition</a>, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It’s for people who still want to experience AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5’s $1,793.98 starting price is too high, the G15’s $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.</p>
<p id="f1czH6">The G15’s speckled design might look familiar to you. That’s because Dell actually launched the Intel-based version of this model already, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319292/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-2021-announced-china-paint-speckles-specs">but in China first</a>. This new Ryzen-based laptop is landing first in China as well, on April 30th, followed by a May 4th release elsewhere around the globe. </p>
