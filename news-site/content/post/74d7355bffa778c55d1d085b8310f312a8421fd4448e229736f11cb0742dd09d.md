  <p id="AOo2aG">As all adults across the US become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Facebook is making it easier for its users to find information based on where they live. The company has started rolling out a feature that pins a box with state-specific information about <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/">where to get a COVID-19 vaccine</a> at the top of the News Feed for every US user living in a state where the general public is eligible to receive the shot. </p>
<p id="AmIyfF">The box, once available, will appear at the top of your News Feed and show you state-specific information, confirming that you are now eligible to receive the vaccine, including a link on where to find the vaccine in your province, as seen in the image below:</p>
