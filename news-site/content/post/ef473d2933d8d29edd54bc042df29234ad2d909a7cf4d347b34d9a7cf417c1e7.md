  <p id="fTKLcI">The organizers of Fyre Festival — think: The Hunger Games, but for influencers — have agreed to a settlement with 277 attendees for $7,220 apiece, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/arts/music/fyre-festival-settlement.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a>. </p>
<p id="BYK4el">Tickets for the 2017 “luxury” music festival on a remote island in the Bahamas that actually turned out to be a beach full of FEMA <a href="https://twitter.com/WNFIV/status/857744138019753984">tents</a> and some pathetic cheese sandwiches, cost anywhere from $1,000 to as much as $12,000 — more if you bought a package deal. Yes, really, because Fyre Festival organizers, while apparently not adept enough to coordinate hotel bookings and a caterer, did enlist big-name Instagram stars to sing the praises of the inaugural event, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid">Kendall Jenner, who received $250,000</a> for a post she’s since deleted. </p>
