The new truck will be powered by GM’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla">new EV battery</a> and will offer around 400 miles on a full charge. </p>
<p id="izXau9">The company did not immediately say when the electric Silverado will go on sale, but GM president Mark Reuss said at an event on Tuesday that the company will also make commercial fleet-focused versions of the truck. GM has been <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34732462/gm-chevy-electric-truck-teased/">teasing an electric Silverado</a> for months now. It previously said <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31227446/chevy-electric-pickup-confirmed-2025/">it may not release a pickup EV until mid-decade</a> and hadn’t officially announced the truck was coming until Tuesday.</p>
<p id="zBPerP">The electric Silverado will be made at “Factory Zero,” the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles">recently rebranded Detroit-Hamtramck...</a></p>
